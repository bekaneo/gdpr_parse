Related Related WP29 opinion on data processing at work Where the word \u201cemployee\u201d is used in this Opinion, WP29 does not intend to restrict the scope of this term merely to persons with an employment contract recognized as such under applicable labour laws. Over the past decades, new business models served by different types of labour relationships, and in particular employment on a freelance basis, have become more commonplace. This Opinion is intended to cover all situations where there is an employment relationship, regardless of whether this relationship is based on an employment contract. 2. Those rules shall include suitable and specific measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s human dignity, legitimate interests and fundamental rights, with particular regard to the transparency of processing, the transfer of personal data within a group of undertakings, or a group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity and monitoring systems at the work place.

The controller must be clear and open with the data subject about how they will collect, use and share personal data. Transparency is about enabling data subjects to understand, and if necessary, make use of their rights in Articles 15 to 22. The principle is embedded in Articles 12, 13, 14 and 34. Measures and safeguards put in place to support the principle of transparency should also support the implementation of these Articles. 66. Key design and default elements for the principle of transparency may include: \u2022Clarity \u2013 Information shall be in clear and plain language, concise and intelligible. \u2022Semantics \u2013 Communication should have a clear meaning to the audience in question. \u2022Accessibility \u2013 Information shall be easily accessible for the data subject. \u2022Contextual \u2013 Information should be provided at the relevant time and in the appropriate form. \u2022Relevance \u2013 Information should be relevant and applicable to the specific data subject. \u2022Universal design \u2013 Information shall be accessible to all data subjects, include use of machine readable languages to facilitate and automate readability and clarity. \u2022Comprehensible \u2013 Data subjects should have a fair understanding of what they can expect with regards to the processing of their personal data, particularly when the data subjects are children or other vulnerable groups. \u2022 Multi-channel \u2013 Information should be provided in different channels and media, not only the textual, to increase the probability for the information to effectively reach the data subject. \u2022 Layered \u2013 The information should be layered in a manner that resolves the tension between completeness and understanding, while accounting for data subjects\u2019 reasonable expectations. 3. Each Member State shall notify to the Commission those provisions of its law which it adopts pursuant to paragraph 1, by 25 May 2018 and, without delay, any subsequent amendment affecting them.",

Related Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) \u201cAn establishment in the Union\u201d The threshold for \u201cstable arrangement [9]\u201d can actually be quite low when the centre of activities of a controller concerns the provision of services online. As a result, in some circumstances, the presence of one single employee or agent of a non-EU entity in the Union may be sufficient to constitute a stable arrangement (amounting to an \u2018establishment\u2019 for the purposes of Art 3(1)) if that employee or agent acts with a sufficient degree of stability. Conversely, when an employee is based in the EU but the processing is not being carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee in the Union (i.e. the processing relates to activities of the controller outside the EU), the mere presence of an employee in the EU will not result in that processing falling within the scope of the GDPR. In other words, the mere presence of an employee in the EU is not as such sufficient to trigger the application of the GDPR, since for the processing in question to fall within the scope of the GDPR, it must also be carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee. [9] Weltimmo, paragraph 31. The fact that the non-EU entity responsible for the data processing does not have a branch or subsidiary in a Member State does not preclude it from having an establishment there within the meaning of EU data protection law. Although the notion of establishment is broad, it is not without limits. It is not possible to conclude that the non-EU entity has an establishment in the Union merely because the undertaking\u2019s website is accessible in the Union [10].

The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation.

A transfer of personal data to a third country or an international organisation may take place where the Commission has decided that the third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within that third country, or the international organisation in question ensures an adequate level of protection. Such a transfer shall not require any specific authorisation. Recitals Recitals (103) The Commission may decide with effect for the entire Union that a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, offers an adequate level of data protection, thus providing legal certainty and uniformity throughout the Union as regards the third country or international organisation which is considered to provide such level of protection. In such cases, transfers of personal data to that third country or international organisation may take place without the need to obtain any further authorisation. The Commission may also decide, having given notice and a full statement setting out the reasons to the third country or international organisation, to revoke such a decision. 2. When assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, the Commission shall, in particular, take account of the following elements: Recitals Recitals (104) In line with the fundamental values on which the Union is founded, in particular the protection of human rights, the Commission should, in its assessment of the third country, or of a territory or specified sector within a third country, take into account how a particular third country respects the rule of law, access to justice as well as international human rights norms and standards and its general and sectoral law, including legislation concerning public security, defence and national security as well as public order and criminal law. The adoption of an adequacy decision with regard to a territory or a specified sector in a third country should take into account clear and objective criteria, such as specific processing activities and the scope of applicable legal standards and legislation in force in the third country. The third country should offer guarantees ensuring an adequate level of protection essentially equivalent to that ensured within the Union, in particular where personal data are processed in one or several specific sectors. In particular, the third country should ensure effective independent data protection supervision and should provide for cooperation mechanisms with the Member States' data protection authorities, and the data subjects should be provided with effective and enforceable rights and effective administrative and judicial redress. (105) Apart from the international commitments the third country or international organisation has entered into, the Commission should take account of obligations arising from the third country's or international organisation's participation in multilateral or regional systems in particular in relation to the protection of personal data, as well as the implementation of such obligations. In particular, the third country's accession to the Council of Europe Convention of 28 January 1981 for the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Automatic Processing of Personal Data and its Additional Protocol should be taken into account. The Commission should consult the Board when assessing the level of protection in third countries or international organisations. (a) the rule of law, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, relevant legislation, both general and sectoral, including concerning public security, defence, national security and criminal law and the access of public authorities to personal data, as well as the implementation of such legislation, data protection rules, professional rules and security measures, including rules for the onward transfer of personal data to another third country or international organisation which are complied with in that country or international organisation, case-law, as well as effective and enforceable data subject rights and effective administrative and judicial redress for the data subjects whose personal data are being transferred; (b) the existence and effective functioning of one or more independent supervisory authorities in the third country or to which an international organisation is subject, with responsibility for ensuring and enforcing compliance with the data protection rules, including adequate enforcement powers, for assisting and advising the data subjects in exercising their rights and for cooperation with the supervisory authorities of the Member States; and (c) the international commitments the third country or international organisation concerned has entered into, or other obligations arising from legally binding conventions or instruments as well as from its participation in multilateral or regional systems, in particular in relation to the protection of personal data. 3. The Commission, after assessing the adequacy of the level of protection, may decide, by means of implementing act, that a third country, a territory or one or more specified sectors within a third country, or an international organisation ensures an adequate level of protection within the meaning of paragraph 2 of this Article. The implementing act shall provide for a mechanism for a periodic review, at least every four years, which shall take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. The implementing act shall specify its territorial and sectoral application and, where applicable, identify the supervisory authority or authorities referred to in point (b) of paragraph 2 of this Article.

Recitals Recitals (106) The Commission should monitor the functioning of decisions on the level of protection in a third country, a territory or specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation, and monitor the functioning of decisions adopted on the basis of Article 25(6) or Article 26(4) of Directive 95/46/EC. In its adequacy decisions, the Commission should provide for a periodic review mechanism of their functioning. That periodic review should be conducted in consultation with the third country or international organisation in question and take into account all relevant developments in the third country or international organisation. For the purposes of monitoring and of carrying out the periodic reviews, the Commission should take into consideration the views and findings of the European Parliament and of the Council as well as of other relevant bodies and sources. The Commission should evaluate, within a reasonable time, the functioning of the latter decisions and report any relevant findings to the Committee within the meaning of Regulation (EU) No 182/2011 of the European Parliament and of the Council [12] as established under this Regulation, to the European Parliament and to the Council.

Recitals Recitals (107) The Commission may recognise that a third country, a territory or a specified sector within a third country, or an international organisation no longer ensures an adequate level of data protection. Consequently the transfer of personal data to that third country or international organisation should be prohibited, unless the requirements in this Regulation relating to transfers subject to appropriate safeguards, including binding corporate rules, and derogations for specific situations are fulfilled. In that case, provision should be made for consultations between the Commission and such third countries or international organisations. The Commission should, in a timely manner, inform the third country or international organisation of the reasons and enter into consultations with it in order to remedy the situation. 7.

Such appropriate safeguards may consist of making use of binding corporate rules, standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission, standard data protection clauses adopted by a supervisory authority or contractual clauses authorised by a supervisory authority. Those safeguards should ensure compliance with data protection requirements and the rights of the data subjects appropriate to processing within the Union, including the availability of enforceable data subject rights and of effective legal remedies, including to obtain effective administrative or judicial redress and to claim compensation, in the Union or in a third country. They should relate in particular to compliance with the general principles relating to personal data processing, the principles of data protection by design and by default. Transfers may also be carried out by public authorities or bodies with public authorities or bodies in third countries or with international organisations with corresponding duties or functions, including on the basis of provisions to be inserted into administrative arrangements, such as a memorandum of understanding, providing for enforceable and effective rights for data subjects. Authorisation by the competent supervisory authority should be obtained when the safeguards are provided for in administrative arrangements that are not legally binding.

While that obligation produces administrative and financial burdens, it did not in all cases contribute to improving the protection of personal data. Such indiscriminate general notification obligations should therefore be abolished, and replaced by effective procedures and mechanisms which focus instead on those types of processing operations which are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons by virtue of their nature, scope, context and purposes. Such types of processing operations may be those which in, particular, involve using new technologies, or are of a new kind and where no data protection impact assessment has been carried out before by the controller, or where they become necessary in the light of the time that has elapsed since the initial processing. (90) In such cases, a data protection impact assessment should be carried out by the controller prior to the processing in order to assess the particular likelihood and severity of the high risk, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing and the sources of the risk.

The controller must be clear and open with the data subject about how they will collect, use and share personal data. Transparency is about enabling data subjects to understand, and if necessary, make use of their rights in Articles 15 to 22. The principle is embedded in Articles 12, 13, 14 and 34. Measures and safeguards put in place to support the principle of transparency should also support the implementation of these Articles. 66. Key design and default elements for the principle of transparency may include: \u2022Clarity \u2013 Information shall be in clear and plain language, concise and intelligible. \u2022Semantics \u2013 Communication should have a clear meaning to the audience in question. \u2022Accessibility \u2013 Information shall be easily accessible for the data subject. \u2022Contextual \u2013 Information should be provided at the relevant time and in the appropriate form. \u2022Relevance \u2013 Information should be relevant and applicable to the specific data subject. \u2022Universal design \u2013 Information shall be accessible to all data subjects, include use of machine readable languages to facilitate and automate readability and clarity. \u2022Comprehensible \u2013 Data subjects should have a fair understanding of what they can expect with regards to the processing of their personal data, particularly when the data subjects are children or other vulnerable groups. \u2022 Multi-channel \u2013 Information should be provided in different channels and media, not only the textual, to increase the probability for the information to effectively reach the data subject. \u2022 Layered \u2013 The information should be layered in a manner that resolves the tension between completeness and understanding, while accounting for data subjects\u2019 reasonable expectations.

Subject-matter and objectives 1. Taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure and to be able to demonstrate that processing is performed in accordance with this Regulation. Those measures shall be reviewed and updated where necessary. 2. Where proportionate in relation to processing activities, the measures referred to in paragraph 1 shall include the implementation of appropriate data protection policies by the controller. 3. Adherence to approved codes of conduct as referred to in Article 40 or approved certification mechanisms as referred to in Article 42 may be used as an element by which to demonstrate compliance with the obligations of the controller. Article 25 GDPR. Data protection by design and by default 1. Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects. 2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual\u2019s intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons. 3.

Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation. 2. The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78. Article 79 GDPR. Right to an effective judicial remedy against a controller or processor 1. Without prejudice to any available administrative or non-judicial remedy, including the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority pursuant to Article 77, each data subject shall have the right to an effective judicial remedy where he or she considers that his or her rights under this Regulation have been infringed as a result of the processing of his or her personal data in non-compliance with this Regulation. 2. Proceedings against a controller or a processor shall be brought before the courts of the Member State where the controller or processor has an establishment. Alternatively, such proceedings may be brought before the courts of the Member State where the data subject has his or her habitual residence, unless the controller or processor is a public authority of a Member State acting in the exercise of its public powers. 3. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, codes of conduct approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article and having general validity pursuant to paragraph 9 of this Article may also be adhered to by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 in order to provide appropriate safeguards within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (e) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards including with regard to the rights of data subjects.

The WP29 recommends that the following factors, in particular, be considered when determining whether the processing is carried out on a large scale: \u2022 the number of data subjects concerned \u2013 either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population \u2022 the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed \u2022 the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity \u2022 the geographical extent of the processing activity. Examples of large scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data in the regular course of business by a hospital \u2022 processing of travel data of individuals using a city\u2019s public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel cards) \u2022 processing of real time geo-location data of customers of an international fast food chain for statistical purposes by a processor specialised in these activities \u2022 processing of customer data in the regular course of business by an insurance company or a bank \u2022 processing of personal data for behavioural advertising by a search engine \u2022 processing of data (content, traffic, location) by telephone or internet service providers. Examples that do not constitute large-scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data by an individual physician \u2022 processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences by an individual lawyer. Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.1.2 \u2018CORE ACTIVITIES\u2019 Article 37(1)(b) and (c) of the GDPR refers to the \u2018core activities of the controller or processor\u2019. Recital 97 specifies that the core activities of a controller relate to \u2018primary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities\u2019. \u2018Core activities\u2019 can be considered as the key operations necessary to achieve the controller\u2019s or processor\u2019s goals. However, \u2018core activities\u2019 should not be interpreted as excluding activities where the processing of data forms an inextricable part of the controller\u2019s or processor\u2019s activity. For example, the core activity of a hospital is to provide health care. However, a hospital could not provide healthcare safely and effectively without processing health data, such as patients\u2019 health records. Therefore, processing these data should be considered to be one of any hospital\u2019s core activities and hospitals must therefore designate DPOs. 2.1.4 \u2018REGULAR AND SYSTEMATIC MONITORING\u2019 WP29 interprets \u2018regular\u2019 as meaning one or more of the following: \u2022 ongoing or occurring at particular intervals for a particular period \u2022 recurring or repeated at fixed times \u2022 constantly or periodically taking place. WP29 interprets \u2018systematic\u2019 as meaning one or more of the following: \u2022 occurring according to a system \u2022 pre-arranged, organised or methodical \u2022 taking place as part of a general plan for data collection \u2022 carried out as part of a strategy. (c) the core activities of the controller or the processor consist of processing on a large scale of special categories of data pursuant to Article 9 or personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10. Related Related Article 9 GDPR. Processing of special categories of personal data 1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject; [\u2026] Article 10 GDPR. Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1) shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority. Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) The GDPR does not define what constitutes large-scale processing. The WP29 recommends that the following factors, in particular, be considered when determining whether the processing is carried out on a large scale: \u2022 the number of data subjects concerned \u2013 either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population \u2022 the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed \u2022 the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity \u2022 the geographical extent of the processing activity. Examples of large scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data in the regular course of business by a hospital \u2022 processing of travel data of individuals using a city\u2019s public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel cards) \u2022 processing of real time geo-location data of customers of an international fast food chain for statistical purposes by a processor specialised in these activities \u2022 processing of customer data in the regular course of business by an insurance company or a bank \u2022 processing of personal data for behavioural advertising by a search engine \u2022 processing of data (content, traffic, location) by telephone or internet service providers. Examples that do not constitute large-scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data by an individual physician \u2022 processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences by an individual lawyer. Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.1.2 \u2018CORE ACTIVITIES\u2019 Article 37(1)(b) and (c) of the GDPR refers to the \u2018core activities of the controller or processor\u2019. Recital 97 specifies that the core activities of a controller relate to \u2018primary activities and do not relate to the processing of personal data as ancillary activities\u2019. \u2018Core activities\u2019 can be considered as the key operations necessary to achieve the controller\u2019s or processor\u2019s goals. However, \u2018core activities\u2019 should not be interpreted as excluding activities where the processing of data forms an inextricable part of the controller\u2019s or processor\u2019s activity. For example, the core activity of a hospital is to provide health care. However, a hospital could not provide healthcare safely and effectively without processing health data, such as patients\u2019 health records. Therefore, processing these data should be considered to be one of any hospital\u2019s core activities and hospitals must therefore designate DPOs. 2. A group of undertakings may appoint a single data protection officer provided that a data protection officer is easily accessible from each establishment. Related Related Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 The \u201ceasily accessible\u201d element means that the data subject should not have to seek out the information; it should be immediately apparent to them where and how this information can be accessed, for example by providing it directly to them, by linking them to it, by clearly signposting it or as an answer to a natural language question (for example in an online layered privacy statement/ notice, in FAQs, by way of contextual pop-ups which activate when a data subject fills in an online form, or in an interactive digital context through a chatbot interface, etc. These mechanisms are further considered below, including at paragraphs 33 to 40). Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) \u201cAn establishment in the Union\u201d The threshold for \u201cstable arrangement [9]\u201d can actually be quite low when the centre of activities of a controller concerns the provision of services online. As a result, in some circumstances, the presence of one single employee or agent of a non-EU entity in the Union may be sufficient to constitute a stable arrangement (amounting to an \u2018establishment\u2019 for the purposes of Art 3(1)) if that employee or agent acts with a sufficient degree of stability. Conversely, when an employee is based in the EU but the processing is not being carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee in the Union (i.e. the processing relates to activities of the controller outside the EU), the mere presence of an employee in the EU will not result in that processing falling within the scope of the GDPR. In other words, the mere presence of an employee in the EU is not as such sufficient to trigger the application of the GDPR, since for the processing in question to fall within the scope of the GDPR, it must also be carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee. [9] Weltimmo, paragraph 31. The fact that the non-EU entity responsible for the data processing does not have a branch or subsidiary in a Member State does not preclude it from having an establishment there within the meaning of EU data protection law. Although the notion of establishment is broad, it is not without limits. It is not possible to conclude that the non-EU entity has an establishment in the Union merely because the undertaking\u2019s website is accessible in the Union [10]. [10] CJEU, Verein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation v. Amazon EU Sarl, Case C\u2011191/15, 28 July 2016, paragraph 76 (hereafter \u201cVerein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation\u201d). Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.3. Designation of a single DPO for several organisations Article 37(2) allows a group of undertakings to designate a single DPO provided that he or she is \u2018easily accessible from each establishment\u2019. The notion of accessibility refers to the tasks of the DPO as a contact point with respect to data subjects [19], the supervisory authority [20] but also internally within the organisation, considering that one of the tasks of the DPO is \u2018to inform and advise the controller and the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation\u2019 [21]. [19] Article 38(4): \u2018data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation\u2019. [20] Article 39(1)(e): \u2018act as a contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36 and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter\u2019. [21] Article 39(1)(a). In order to ensure that the DPO, whether internal or external, is accessible it is important to make sure that their contact details are available in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR [22]. [22] See also Section 2.6 below. He or she, with the help of a team if necessary, must be in a position to efficiently communicate with data subjects [23] and cooperate [24] with the supervisory authorities concerned. This also means that this communication must take place in the language or languages used by the supervisory authorities and the data subjects concerned. The availability of a DPO (whether physically on the same premises as employees, via a hotline or other secure means of communication) is essential to ensure that data subjects will be able to contact the DPO. [23] Article 12(1): \u2019The controller shall take appropriate measures to provide any information referred to in Articles 13 and 14 and any communication under Articles 15 to 22 and 34 relating to processing to the data subject in a concise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language, in particular for any information addressed specifically to a child\u2019. [24] Article 39(1)(d) : \u2018to cooperate with the supervisory authority\u2019 3. Where the controller or the processor is a public authority or body, a single data protection officer may be designated for several such authorities or bodies, taking account of their organisational structure and size. Related Related Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.1.1 \u2018PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR BODY\u2019 The GDPR does not define what constitutes a \u2018public authority or body\u2019. The WP29 considers that such a notion is to be determined under national law. Accordingly, public authorities and bodies include national, regional and local authorities, but the concept, under the applicable national laws, typically also includes a range of other bodies governed by public law [12]. In such cases, the designation of a DPO is mandatory. [12] See, e.g. the definition of \u2018public sector body\u2019 and \u2018body governed by public law\u2019 in Article 2(1) and (2) of Directive 2003/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 November 2003 on the re-use of public-sector information (OJ L 345, 31.12.2003, p. 90). A public task may be carried out, and public authority may be exercised [13] not only by public authorities or bodies but also by other natural or legal persons governed by public or private law, in sectors such as, according to national regulation of each Member State, public transport services, water and energy supply, road infrastructure, public service broadcasting, public housing or disciplinary bodies for regulated professions. [13] Article 6(1)(e). 4. In cases other than those referred to in paragraph 1, the controller or processor or associations and other bodies representing categories of controllers or processors may or, where required by Union or Member State law shall, designate a data protection officer. The data protection officer may act for such associations and other bodies representing controllers or processors. 5. The data protection officer shall be designated on the basis of professional qualities and, in particular, expert knowledge of data protection law and practices and the ability to fulfil the tasks referred to in Article 39. Related Related Article 39 GDPR. Tasks of the data protection officer 1. The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks: (a) to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions; (b) to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits; (c) to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35; (d) to cooperate with the supervisory authority; (e) to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter. 2. The data protection officer shall in the performance of his or her tasks have due regard to the risk associated with processing operations, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing. Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 8. What are the professional qualities that the DPO should have? The necessary level of expert knowledge should be determined according to the data processing operations carried out and the protection required for the personal data being processed. For example, where a data processing activity is particularly complex, or where a large amount of sensitive data is involved, the DPO may need a higher level of expertise and support. Relevant skills and expertise include: \u2022 expertise in national and European data protection laws and practices including an in-depth understanding of the GDPR \u2022 understanding of the processing operations carried out \u2022 understanding of information technologies and data security \u2022 knowledge of the business sector and the organisation \u2022 ability to promote a data protection culture within the organisation. 6. The data protection officer may be a staff member of the controller or processor, or fulfil the tasks on the basis of a service contract. 7. The controller or the processor shall publish the contact details of the data protection officer and communicate them to the supervisory authority.",

The controller and the processor shall ensure that the data protection officer is involved, properly and in a timely manner, in all issues which relate to the protection of personal data. 2. The controller and processor shall support the data protection officer in performing the tasks referred to in Article 39 by providing resources necessary to carry out those tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge. Related Related Article 39 GDPR. Tasks of the data protection officer 1. The data protection officer shall have at least the following tasks: (a) to inform and advise the controller or the processor and the employees who carry out processing of their obligations pursuant to this Regulation and to other Union or Member State data protection provisions; (b) to monitor compliance with this Regulation, with other Union or Member State data protection provisions and with the policies of the controller or processor in relation to the protection of personal data, including the assignment of responsibilities, awareness-raising and training of staff involved in processing operations, and the related audits; (c) to provide advice where requested as regards the data protection impact assessment and monitor its performance pursuant to Article 35; (d) to cooperate with the supervisory authority; (e) to act as the contact point for the supervisory authority on issues relating to processing, including the prior consultation referred to in Article 36, and to consult, where appropriate, with regard to any other matter. 2.

Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 3.2. Necessary resources Article 38(2) of the GDPR requires the organisation to support its DPO by \u2018providing resources necessary to carry out [their] tasks and access to personal data and processing operations, and to maintain his or her expert knowledge\u2019. The following items, in particular, are to be considered: \u2022 active support of the DPO\u2019s function by senior management (such as at board level) \u2022 sufficient time for DPOs to fulfil their duties. This is particularly important where an internal DPO is appointed on a part-time basis or where the external DPO carries out data protection in addition to other duties. Otherwise, conflicting priorities could result in the DPO\u2019s duties being neglected. Having sufficient time to devote to DPO tasks is paramount. It is a good practice to establish a percentage of time for the DPO function where it is not performed on a full-time basis. It is also good practice to determine the time needed to carry out the function, the appropriate level of priority for DPO duties, and for the DPO (or the organisation) to draw up a work plan \u2022 adequate support in terms of financial resources, infrastructure (premises, facilities, equipment) and staff where appropriate \u2022 official communication of the designation of the DPO to all staff to ensure that their existence and function are known within the organisation \u2022 necessary access to other services, such as Human Resources, legal, IT, security, etc., so that DPOs can receive essential support, input and information from those other services \u2022 continuous training. DPOs must be given the opportunity to stay up to date with regard to developments within the field of data protection. The aim should be to constantly increase the level of expertise of DPOs and they should be encouraged to participate in training courses on data protection and other forms of professional development, such as participation in privacy fora, workshops, etc. \u2022 given the size and structure of the organisation, it may be necessary to set up a DPO team (a DPO and his/her staff). In such cases, the internal structure of the team and the tasks and responsibilities of each of its members should be clearly drawn up. Similarly, when the function of the DPO is exercised by an external service provider, a team of individuals working for that entity may effectively carry out the tasks of a DPO as a team, under the responsibility of a designated lead contact for the client. 3. The controller and processor shall ensure that the data protection officer does not receive any instructions regarding the exercise of those tasks. He or she shall not be dismissed or penalised by the controller or the processor for performing his tasks. The data protection officer shall directly report to the highest management level of the controller or the processor. Related Related Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 3.3. Instructions and \u2018performing their duties and tasks in an independent manner\u2019 This means that, in fulfilling their tasks under Article 39, DPOs must not be instructed how to deal with a matter, for example, what result should be achieved, how to investigate a complaint or whether to consult the supervisory authority. Furthermore, they must not be instructed to take a certain view of an issue related to data protection law, for example, a particular interpretation of the law. 4. Data subjects may contact the data protection officer with regard to all issues related to processing of their personal data and to the exercise of their rights under this Regulation. 5. The data protection officer shall be bound by secrecy or confidentiality concerning the performance of his or her tasks, in accordance with Union or Member State law. ISO 27701 ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added a requirement additional to ISO/IEC 27002, section 13.2.4. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 5(1)(f) GDPR: 6.10.2.4 Confidentiality or non-disclosure agreements Implementation guidance The organization should ensure that individuals operating under its control with access to PII are subject to a confidentiality obligation.

Where a type of processing in particular using new technologies, and taking into account the nature, scope, context and purposes of the processing, is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall, prior to the processing, carry out an assessment of the impact of the envisaged processing operations on the protection of personal data. A single assessment may address a set of similar processing operations that present similar high risks. ISO 27701 Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII processors. Here is the relevant paragraph to articles 35(1) GDPR: 8.2.1 Customer agreement Control The organization should ensure, where relevant, that the contract to process PII addresses the organization\u2019s role in providing assistance with the customer\u2019s obligations (taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the organization). Implementation guidance The contract between the organization and the customer should include the following wherever relevant, and depending on the customer\u2019s role (PII controller or PII processor) (this list is neither definitive nor exhaustive): [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Related Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 2.1.3.3 \u201cnature, scope, context and purpose of processing\u201d 28. In short, the concept of nature can be understood as the inherent[11] characteristics of the processing. The scope refers to the size and range of the processing. The context relates to the circumstances of the processing, which may influence the expectations of the data subject, while the purpose pertains to the aims of the processing. [11] Examples are special categories personal data, automatic decision-making, skewed power relations, unpredictable processing, difficulties for the data subject to exercise the rights, etc. 2. The controller shall seek the advice of the data protection officer, where designated, when carrying out a data protection impact assessment. 3. A data protection impact assessment referred to in paragraph 1 shall in particular be required in the case of: (a) a systematic and extensive evaluation of personal aspects relating to natural persons which is based on automated processing, including profiling, and on which decisions are based that produce legal effects concerning the natural person or similarly significantly affect the natural person; (b) processing on a large scale of special categories of data referred to in Article 9(1), or of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences referred to in Article 10; or Related Related Article 9 GDPR. Processing of special categories of personal data 1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. [\u2026] Article 10 GDPR. Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences Processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6(1) shall be carried out only under the control of official authority or when the processing is authorised by Union or Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the rights and freedoms of data subjects. Any comprehensive register of criminal convictions shall be kept only under the control of official authority. Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.1.3 \u2018LARGE SCALE\u2019 In any event, the WP29 recommends that the following factors, in particular, be considered when determining whether the processing is carried out on a large scale: \u2022 the number of data subjects concerned \u2013 either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population \u2022 the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed \u2022 the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity \u2022 the geographical extent of the processing activity. Examples of large-scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data in the regular course of business by a hospital \u2022 processing of travel data of individuals using a city\u2019s public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel cards) \u2022 processing of real time geo-location data of customers of an international fast food chain for statistical purposes by a processor specialised in providing these services \u2022 processing of customer data in the regular course of business by an insurance company or a bank \u2022 processing of personal data for behavioural advertising by a search engine \u2022 processing of data (content, traffic, location) by telephone or internet service providers. Examples that do not constitute large-scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data by an individual physician \u2022 processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences by an individual lawyer. (c) a systematic monitoring of a publicly accessible area on a large scale. Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Documents EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020). 4. The supervisory authority shall establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations which are subject to the requirement for a data protection impact assessment pursuant to paragraph 1. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board referred to in Article 68. Related Related Article 68 GDPR. European Data Protection Board 1. The European Data Protection Board (the \u2018Board\u2019) is hereby established as a body of the Union and shall have legal personality. 2. The Board shall be represented by its Chair. 3. The Board shall be composed of the head of one supervisory authority of each Member State and of the European Data Protection Supervisor, or their respective representatives. 4. Where in a Member State more than one supervisory authority is responsible for monitoring the application of the provisions pursuant to this Regulation, a joint representative shall be appointed in accordance with that Member State\u2019s law. 5. The Commission shall have the right to participate in the activities and meetings of the Board without voting right. The Commission shall designate a representative. The Chair of the Board shall communicate to the Commission the activities of the Board. 6. In the cases referred to in Article 65, the European Data Protection Supervisor shall have voting rights only on decisions which concern principles and rules applicable to the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies which correspond in substance to those of this Regulation. 5. The supervisory authority may also establish and make public a list of the kind of processing operations for which no data protection impact assessment is required. The supervisory authority shall communicate those lists to the Board. 6. Prior to the adoption of the lists referred to in paragraphs 4 and 5, the competent supervisory authority shall apply the consistency mechanism referred to in Article 63 where such lists involve processing activities which are related to the offering of goods or services to data subjects or to the monitoring of their behaviour in several Member States, or may substantially affect the free movement of personal data within the Union. Related Related Article 63 GDPR. Consistency mechanism Article 4 GDPR. Definitions In order to contribute to the consistent application of this Regulation throughout the Union, the supervisory authorities shall cooperate with each other and, where relevant, with the Commission, through the consistency mechanism as set out in this Section. Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to data subjects in the Union The first activity triggering the application of Article 3(2) is the \u201coffering of goods or services\u201d, a concept which has been further addressed by EU law and case law, which should be taken into account when applying the targeting criterion. The offering of services also includes the offering of information society services, defined in point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 [23] as \u201cany Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services\u201d. [23] Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services. Another key element to be assessed in determining whether the Article 3(2)(a) targeting criterion can be met is whether the offer of goods or services is directed at a person in the Union, or in other words, whether the conduct on the part of the controller, which determines the means and purposes of processing, demonstrates its intention to offer goods or a services to a data subject located in the Union. Recital 23 of the GDPR indeed clarifies that \u201cin order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union.\u201d 7. The assessment shall contain at least: (a) a systematic description of the envisaged processing operations and the purposes of the processing, including, where applicable, the legitimate interest pursued by the controller; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Case law CJEU, Fashion ID GmbH & Co. KG/Verbraucherzentrale NRW eV, C-40/17 (2019). (b) an assessment of the necessity and proportionality of the processing operations in relation to the purposes; (c) an assessment of the risks to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1; and (d) the measures envisaged to address the risks, including safeguards, security measures and mechanisms to ensure the protection of personal data and to demonstrate compliance with this Regulation taking into account the rights and legitimate interests of data subjects and other persons concerned. 8. Compliance with approved codes of conduct referred to in Article 40 by the relevant controllers or processors shall be taken into due account in assessing the impact of the processing operations performed by such controllers or processors, in particular for the purposes of a data protection impact assessment. Related Related Article 40 GDPR. Codes of conduct 9. Where appropriate, the controller shall seek the views of data subjects or their representatives on the intended processing, without prejudice to the protection of commercial or public interests or the security of processing operations. ISO 27701 ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added a requirement additional to ISO/IEC 27001, section 4.2. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 35(9) GDPR: 5.2.2 Understanding the needs and expectations of interested parties The organization shall include among its interested parties (see ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 4.2), those parties having interests or responsibilities associated with the processing of PII, including the PII principals. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text 10. Where processing pursuant to point (c) or (e) of Article 6(1) has a legal basis in Union law or in the law of the Member State to which the controller is subject, that law regulates the specific processing operation or set of operations in question, and a data protection impact assessment has already been carried out as part of a general impact assessment in the context of the adoption of that legal basis, paragraphs 1 to 7 shall not apply unless Member States deem it to be necessary to carry out such an assessment prior to processing activities. Related Related Article 6 GDPR. Lawfulness of processing 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: [\u2026] (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; [\u2026] (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; 11. Where necessary, the controller shall carry out a review to assess if processing is performed in accordance with the data protection impact assessment at least when there is a change of the risk represented by processing operations.",

Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller and the processor shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, including inter alia as appropriate: Guidelines & Case Law Related Guidelines & Case Law Documents EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020). Related Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 2.1.3.1 \u201cstate of the art\u201d 18. The concept of \u201cstate of the art\u201d is present in various EU acquis, e.g. environmental protection and product safety. In the GDPR, reference to the \u201cstate of the art\u201d [8] is made not only in Article 32, for security measures,[9][10] but also in Article 25, thus extending this benchmark to all technical and organisational measures embedded in the processing. [8] See German Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s \u201cKalkar\u201d decision in 1978: https://germanlawarchive.iuscomp.org/?p=67 may provide the foundation for a methodology for an objective definition of the concept. On that basis, the \u201cstate of the art\u201d technology level would be identified between the \u201cexisting scientific knowledge and research\u201d technology level and the more established \u201cgenerally accepted rules of technology\u201d. The \u201cstate of the art\u201d can hence be identified as the technology level of a service or technology or product that exists in the market and is most effective in achieving the objectives identified. [9] https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/what-is-state-of-the-art-in-it-security [10] www.teletrust.de/en/publikationen/broschueren/state-of-the-art-in-it-security/ 19. In the context of Article 25, the reference to \u201cstate of the art\u201d imposes an obligation on controllers, when determining the appropriate technical and organisational measures, to take account of the current progress in technology that is available in the market. The requirement is for controllers to have knowledge of, and stay up to date on technological advances; how technology can present data protection risks or opportunities to the processing operation; and how to implement and update the measures and safeguards that secure effective implementation of the principles and rights of data subjects taking into account the evolving technological landscape. 20. The \u201cstate of the art\u201d is a dynamic concept that cannot be statically defined at a fixed point in time, but should be assessed continuously in the context of technological progress. In the face of technological advancements, a controller could find that a measure that once provided an adequate level of protection no longer does. Neglecting to keep up to date with technological changes could therefore result in a lack of compliance with Article 25. 21. The \u201cstate of the art\u201d criterion does not only apply to technological measures, but also to organisational ones. Lack of appropriate organisational measures can lower or even completely undermine the effectiveness of a chosen technology. Examples of organisational measures can be adoption of internal policies; up-to date training on technology, security and data protection; and IT security governance and management policies. 22. Existing and recognized frameworks, standards, certifications, codes of conduct, etc. in different fields may play a role in indicating the current \u201cstate of the art\u201d within the given field of use. Where such standards exist and provide a high level of protection for the data subject in compliance with \u2013 or go beyond \u2013 legal requirements, controllers should take them into account in the design and implementation of data protection measures.

When the personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, the controller shall communicate the personal data breach to the data subject without undue delay. 2. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article shall describe in clear and plain language the nature of the personal data breach and contain at least the information and measures referred to in points (b), (c) and (d) of Article 33(3). Related Related Article 33 GDPR. Notification of a personal data breach to the supervisory authority 1. In the case of a personal data breach, the controller shall without undue delay and, where feasible, not later than 72 hours after having become aware of it, notify the personal data breach to the supervisory authority competent in accordance with Article 55, unless the personal data breach is unlikely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons. Where the notification to the supervisory authority is not made within 72 hours, it shall be accompanied by reasons for the delay. [\u2026] 3. The notification referred to in paragraph 1 shall at least: [\u2026] (b) communicate the name and contact details of the data protection officer or other contact point where more information can be obtained; (c) describe the likely consequences of the personal data breach; (d) describe the measures taken or proposed to be taken by the controller to address the personal data breach, including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects. Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 \u201cClear and plain language\u201d With written information (and where written information is delivered orally, or by audio/ audiovisual methods, including for vision-impaired data subjects), best practices for clear writing should be followed.11 A similar language requirement (for \u201cplain, intelligible language\u201d) has previously been used by the EU legislator12 and is also explicitly referred to in the context of consent in Recital 42 of the GDPR13. The requirement for clear and plain language means that information should be provided in as simple a manner as possible, avoiding complex sentence and language structures. The information should be concrete and definitive; it should not be phrased in abstract or ambivalent terms or leave room for different interpretations. In particular the purposes of, and legal basis for, processing the personal data should be clear. 3. The communication to the data subject referred to in paragraph 1 shall not be required if any of the following conditions are met: (a) the controller has implemented appropriate technical and organisational protection measures, and those measures were applied to the personal data affected by the personal data breach, in particular those that render the personal data unintelligible to any person who is not authorised to access it, such as encryption; (b) the controller has taken subsequent measures which ensure that the high risk to the rights and freedoms of data subjects referred to in paragraph 1 is no longer likely to materialise; (c) it would involve disproportionate effort. In such a case, there shall instead be a public communication or similar measure whereby the data subjects are informed in an equally effective manner. 4. If the controller has not already communicated the personal data breach to the data subject, the supervisory authority, having considered the likelihood of the personal data breach resulting in a high risk, may require it to do so or may decide that any of the conditions referred to in paragraph 3 are met.",

Personal data shall be: (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019); (b) collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes; further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes shall, in accordance with Article 89(1), not be considered to be incompatible with the initial purposes (\u2018purpose limitation\u2019); (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019); (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (\u2018accuracy\u2019); (e) kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed; personal data may be stored for longer periods insofar as the personal data will be processed solely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes in accordance with Article 89(1) subject to implementation of the appropriate technical and organisational measures required by this Regulation in order to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject (\u2018storage limitation\u2019); (f) processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (\u2018integrity and confidentiality\u2019). 2. The controller shall be responsible for, and be able to demonstrate compliance with, paragraph 1 (\u2018accountability\u2019). Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 8. Technical and organizational measures and necessary safeguards can be understood in a broad sense as any method or means that a controller may employ in the processing. Being appropriate means that the measures and necessary safeguards should be suited to achieve the intended purpose, i.e. they must implement the data protection principles effectively.[3] The requirement to appropriateness is thus closely related to the requirement of effectiveness. [3] \u201cEffectiveness\u201d is addressed below in subchapter 2.1.2 9. A technical or organisational measure and safeguard can be anything from the use of advanced technical solutions to the basic training of personnel. Examples that may be suitable, depending on the context and risks associated with the processing in question, includes pseudonymization of personal data [4]; storing personal data available in a structured, commonly machine readable format; enabling data subjects to intervene in the processing; providing information about the storage of personal data; having malware detection systems; training employees about basic \u201ccyber hygiene\u201d; establishing privacy and information security management systems, obligating processors contractually to implement specific data minimisation practices, etc. [4] Defined in Article 4(5) GDPR Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. Addressing effectiveness 13. Effectiveness is at the heart of the concept of data protection by design. The requirement to implement the principles in an effective manner means that controllers must implement the necessary measures and safeguards to protect these principles, in order to secure the rights of data subjects. Each implemented measure should produce the intended results for the processing foreseen by the controller. This observation has two consequences. 14. First, it means that Article 25 does not require the implementation of any specific technical and organizational measures, rather that the chosen measures and safeguards should be specific to the implementation of data protection principles into the particular processing in question. In doing so, the measures and safeguards should be designed to be robust and the controller should be able to implement further measures in order to scale to any increase in risk.[6] Whether or not measures are effective will therefore depend on the context of the processing in question and an assessment of certain elements that should be taken into account when determining the means of processing. The aforementioned elements will be addressed below in subchapter 2.1.3. [6] \u201cFundamental principles applicable to the controllers (i.e. legitimacy, data minimisation, purpose limitation, transparency, data integrity, data accuracy) should remain the same, whatever the processing and the risks for the data subjects. However, due regard to the nature and scope of such processing have always been an integral part of the application of those principles, so that they are inherently scalable.\u201d Article 29 Working Party. \u201cStatement on the role of a risk-based approach in data protection legal frameworks\u201d. WP 218, 30 May 2014, p. 3. ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/documentation/opinion-recommendation/files/2014/wp218_en.pdf 15. Second, controllers should be able to demonstrate that the principles have been maintained. 16. The implemented measures and safeguards should achieve the desired effect in terms of data protection, and the controller should have documentation of the implemented technical and organizational measures.[7] To do so, the controller may determine appropriate key performance indicators (KPI) to demonstrate the effectiveness. A KPI is a measurable value chosen by the controller that demonstrates how effectively the controller achieves their data protection objective. KPIs may be quantitative, such as the percentage of false positives or false negatives, reduction of complaints, reduction of response time when data subjects exercise their rights; or qualitative, such as evaluations of performance, use of grading scales, or expert assessments. Alternatively to KPIs, controllers may be able to demonstrate the effective implementation of the principles by providing the rationale behind their assessment of the effectiveness of the chosen measures and safeguards. [7] See Recitals 74 and 78. Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 2.1.3.1 \u201cstate of the art\u201d 18. The concept of \u201cstate of the art\u201d is present in various EU acquis, e.g. environmental protection and product safety. In the GDPR, reference to the \u201cstate of the art\u201d [8] is made not only in Article 32, for security measures,[9][10] but also in Article 25, thus extending this benchmark to all technical and organisational measures embedded in the processing. [8] See German Federal Constitutional Court\u2019s \u201cKalkar\u201d decision in 1978: https://germanlawarchive.iuscomp.org/?p=67 may provide the foundation for a methodology for an objective definition of the concept. On that basis, the \u201cstate of the art\u201d technology level would be identified between the \u201cexisting scientific knowledge and research\u201d technology level and the more established \u201cgenerally accepted rules of technology\u201d. The \u201cstate of the art\u201d can hence be identified as the technology level of a service or technology or product that exists in the market and is most effective in achieving the objectives identified. [9] https://www.enisa.europa.eu/news/enisa-news/what-is-state-of-the-art-in-it-security [10] www.teletrust.de/en/publikationen/broschueren/state-of-the-art-in-it-security/ 19. In the context of Article 25, the reference to \u201cstate of the art\u201d imposes an obligation on controllers, when determining the appropriate technical and organisational measures, to take account of the current progress in technology that is available in the market. The requirement is for controllers to have knowledge of, and stay up to date on technological advances; how technology can present data protection risks or opportunities to the processing operation; and how to implement and update the measures and safeguards that secure effective implementation of the principles and rights of data subjects taking into account the evolving technological landscape. 20. The \u201cstate of the art\u201d is a dynamic concept that cannot be statically defined at a fixed point in time, but should be assessed continuously in the context of technological progress. In the face of technological advancements, a controller could find that a measure that once provided an adequate level of protection no longer does. Neglecting to keep up to date with technological changes could therefore result in a lack of compliance with Article 25. 21. The \u201cstate of the art\u201d criterion does not only apply to technological measures, but also to organisational ones. Lack of appropriate organisational measures can lower or even completely undermine the effectiveness of a chosen technology. Examples of organisational measures can be adoption of internal policies; up-to date training on technology, security and data protection; and IT security governance and management policies. 22. Existing and recognized frameworks, standards, certifications, codes of conduct, etc. in different fields may play a role in indicating the current \u201cstate of the art\u201d within the given field of use. Where such standards exist and provide a high level of protection for the data subject in compliance with \u2013 or go beyond \u2013 legal requirements, controllers should take them into account in the design and implementation of data protection measures. 2.1.3.2 \u201ccost of implementation\u201d 23. The controller may take the cost of implementation into account when choosing and applying appropriate technical and organisational measures and necessary safeguards that effectively implement the principles in order to protect the rights of data subjects. The cost refers to resources in general, including time and human resources. 2.1.3.3 \u201cnature, scope, context and purpose of processing\u201d 28. In short, the concept of nature can be understood as the inherent[11] characteristics of the processing. The scope refers to the size and range of the processing. The context relates to the circumstances of the processing, which may influence the expectations of the data subject, while the purpose pertains to the aims of the processing. [11] Examples are special categories personal data, automatic decision-making, skewed power relations, unpredictable processing, difficulties for the data subject to exercise the rights, etc. 2.1.3.4 \u201crisks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing\u201d 32. The risk based approach does not exclude the use of baselines, best practices and standards. These might provide a useful toolbox for controllers to tackle similar risks in similar situations (nature, scope, context and purpose of processing). Nevertheless, the obligation in Article 25 (as well as Articles 24, 32 and 35(7)(c)) to take into account \u201crisks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing\u201d remains. Therefore, controllers, although supported by such tools, must always carry out a data protection risk assessment on a case by case basis for the processing activity at hand and verify the effectiveness of the appropriate measures and safeguards proposed. A DPIA, or an update to an existing DPIA, may then additionally be required. 2.1.4.1 At the time of the determination of the means for processing 34. The \u201cmeans for processing\u201d range from the general to the detailed design elements of the processing, including the architecture, procedures, protocols, layout and appearance. 35. The \u201ctime of determination of the means for processing\u201d refers to the period of time when the controller is deciding how the processing will be conducted and the manner in which the processing will occur and the mechanisms which will be used to conduct such processing. It\u2019s in the process of making such decisions that the controller must assess the appropriate measures and safeguards to effectively implement the principles and rights of data subjects into the processing, and take into account elements such as the state of the art, cost of implementation, nature, scope, context and purpose, and risks. This includes the time of procuring and implementing data processing software, hardware, and services. 2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual\u2019s intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons. ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 25(2) GDPR: 7.4.2 Limit processing Control The organization should limit the processing of PII to that which is adequate, relevant and necessary for the identified purposes.

Related Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. By default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed 2.2.1 40. A \u201cdefault\u201d, as commonly defined in computer science, refers to the pre-existing or preselected value of a configurable setting that is assigned to a software application, computer program or device. Such settings are also called \u201cpresets\u201d or \u201cfactory presets\u201d, especially for electronic devices. 41. Hence, the term \u201cby default\u201d when processing personal data, refers to making choices regarding configuration values or processing options that are set or prescribed in a processing system, such as a software application, service or device, or a manual processing procedure that affect the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. 46. The EDPS guidelines to assess necessity and proportionality of measures that limit the right to data protection can be useful also to decide which data is necessary to process in order to achieve a specific purpose.[10][11] [10] EDPS. \u201cGuidelines on assessing the necessity and proportionality of measures that limit the right to data protection\u201d. 25 February 2019.

WP 217, 9 April 2014. 2.2.2.2 \u201cthe extent of their processing\u201d 51. Processing [17] operations performed on personal data shall be limited to what is necessary. As noted above, many processing operations may contribute to a processing purpose, but just because personal data is needed to fulfil a purpose does not mean that all types of, and frequencies of, processing operations may be carried out on the data. Controllers should also be careful not to extend the boundaries of \u201ccompatible purposes\u201d, and have in mind what processing will be within the reasonable expectations of data subjects. [17] According to Art. 4(2) GDPR, this includes collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction. 3.

Here is the relevant paragraph to article 25(3) GDPR: 5.2.1 Understanding the organization and its context The organization shall include among its interested parties (see ISO/IEC 27001:2013, 4.2), those parties having interests or responsibilities associated with the processing of PII, including the PII principals.

The Member States, the supervisory authorities, the Board and the Commission shall encourage, in particular at Union level, the establishment of data protection certification mechanisms and of data protection seals and marks, for the purpose of demonstrating compliance with this Regulation of processing operations by controllers and processors. The specific needs of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises shall be taken into account. 2. In addition to adherence by controllers or processors subject to this Regulation, data protection certification mechanisms, seals or marks approved pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Article may be established for the purpose of demonstrating the existence of appropriate safeguards provided by controllers or processors that are not subject to this Regulation pursuant to Article 3 within the framework of personal data transfers to third countries or international organisations under the terms referred to in point (f) of Article 46(2). Such controllers or processors shall make binding and enforceable commitments, via contractual or other legally binding instruments, to apply those appropriate safeguards, including with regard to the rights of data subjects. 3. The certification shall be voluntary and available via a process that is transparent. 4. A certification pursuant to this Article does not reduce the responsibility of the controller or the processor for compliance with this Regulation and is without prejudice to the tasks and powers of the supervisory authorities which are competent pursuant to Article 55 or 56. 5. A certification pursuant to this Article shall be issued by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority, on the basis of criteria approved by that competent supervisory authority pursuant to Article 58(3) or by the Board pursuant to Article 63. Where the criteria are approved by the Board, this may result in a common certification, the European Data Protection Seal. 6. The controller or processor which submits its processing to the certification mechanism shall provide the certification body referred to in Article 43, or where applicable, the competent supervisory authority, with all information and access to its processing activities which are necessary to conduct the certification procedure. 7. Certification shall be issued to a controller or processor for a maximum period of three years and may be renewed, under the same conditions, provided that the relevant criteria continue to be met. Certification shall be withdrawn, as applicable, by the certification bodies referred to in Article 43 or by the competent supervisory authority where the criteria for the certification are not or are no longer met. 8. The Board shall collate all certification mechanisms and data protection seals and marks in a register and shall make them publicly available by any appropriate means.",

Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.1.3 \u2018LARGE SCALE\u2019 In any event, the WP29 recommends that the following factors, in particular, be considered when determining whether the processing is carried out on a large scale: \u2022 the number of data subjects concerned \u2013 either as a specific number or as a proportion of the relevant population \u2022 the volume of data and/or the range of different data items being processed \u2022 the duration, or permanence, of the data processing activity \u2022 the geographical extent of the processing activity. Examples of large-scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data in the regular course of business by a hospital \u2022 processing of travel data of individuals using a city\u2019s public transport system (e.g. tracking via travel cards) \u2022 processing of real time geo-location data of customers of an international fast food chain for statistical purposes by a processor specialised in providing these services \u2022 processing of customer data in the regular course of business by an insurance company or a bank \u2022 processing of personal data for behavioural advertising by a search engine \u2022 processing of data (content, traffic, location) by telephone or internet service providers. Examples that do not constitute large-scale processing include: \u2022 processing of patient data by an individual physician \u2022 processing of personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences by an individual lawyer. (b) a public authority or body. Related Related Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (\u2018DPOs\u2019) 2.1.1 \u2018PUBLIC AUTHORITY OR BODY\u2019 The GDPR does not define what constitutes a \u2018public authority or body\u2019. The WP29 considers that such a notion is to be determined under national law. Accordingly, public authorities and bodies include national, regional and local authorities, but the concept, under the applicable national laws, typically also includes a range of other bodies governed by public law [12]. In such cases, the designation of a DPO is mandatory.

Related Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to data subjects in the Union The first activity triggering the application of Article 3(2) is the \u201coffering of goods or services\u201d, a concept which has been further addressed by EU law and case law, which should be taken into account when applying the targeting criterion. The offering of services also includes the offering of information society services, defined in point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 [23] as \u201cany Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services\u201d. [23] Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services. Another key element to be assessed in determining whether the Article 3(2)(a) targeting criterion can be met is whether the offer of goods or services is directed at a person in the Union, or in other words, whether the conduct on the part of the controller, which determines the means and purposes of processing, demonstrates its intention to offer goods or a services to a data subject located in the Union. Recital 23 of the GDPR indeed clarifies that \u201cin order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union.\u201d 4. The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 5.

                        "text": "1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. Expert commentary Expert commentary The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. In such cases, the data subject shall have the right to obtain human intervention, to express his or her point of view, to contest the decision and to have it reconsidered. Scope of the Right The applicability of this article is limited to automated data processing where the decisions have a big impact on data subjects. According to the Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679, this article sets up a general ban on deciding based just on automated processing, regardless of whether or not the data subject takes any action. In a nutshell, Article 22 states that: There is a general prohibition on completely automated individual decision-making, including profiling that has a legal or similarly significant effect; There are exceptions to this rule; Where one of these exceptions applies, measures must be in place to protect the data subject\u2019s rights, freedoms, and legitimate interests. But, the Article 22(1) ban only counts in certain cases where a decision based just on automated processing, including profiling, has a legal effect on or similarly affects someone. Even in these cases, there are specified exceptions which allow such processing to take place. Automated Processing An automated process can produce a recommendation about a data subject. If a person reviews and takes into account other elements to make the final decision, it won\u2019t be a decision that\u2019s just based on automated processing. The controller can\u2019t bypass Article 22 requirements by making it look like a human is involved. For example, if someone constantly uses automatically generated profiles for individuals without any actual effect on the result, that\u2019s still a decision based solely on automated processing. To qualify as human involvement, the controller must make sure that any oversight of the decision is significant, not just a formality. It should be done by someone who can override the decision and has the knowledge to consider all the relevant data. Significant Effect Even if a decision-making process does not have an effect on people\u2019s legal rights it could still fall within the scope of Article 22 of the GDPR if it produces an effect that is equivalent or similarly significant in its impact. This means that even if there is no legal change, the data subject could still be impacted enough to require the protections under this provision. The GDPR introduces the word \u2018similarly\u2019 to the phrase \u2018significantly affects\u2019 in order to provide a threshold for significance that is similar to that of a decision producing a legal effect. A legal effect occurs when a decision based solely on automated processing impacts someone\u2019s legal rights, such as freedom of association, voting, and legal action, or creates legal effects like contract cancellation, entitlement/denial of social benefits, denial of admission to a country of refusal in citizenship. According to Recital 71, typical examples of other similarly significant effects could include \u2018automatic refusal of an online credit application\u2019 or \u2018e-recruiting practices without any human intervention\u2019. For data processing to significantly affect someone the effects of the processing must be great or important enough. This could include decisions that affect someone\u2019s financial circumstances, such as their eligibility for credit; decisions that affect someone\u2019s access to health services; decisions that deny someone an employment opportunity or put them at a serious disadvantage; or decisions that affect someone\u2019s access to education, for example, university admissions. In many typical cases, the automated decision to present targeted advertising based on profiling will not have a similarly significant effect on individuals. However, it is possible for data profiling to have an effect on individuals depending on the characteristics of the case. This includes the intrusiveness of the profiling process, the expectations and wishes of the individuals, and the knowledge of the vulnerabilities of the data subjects. Even if it has little effect on some individuals, it can have a significant impact on certain groups, such as minority groups or vulnerable adults. Similarly, automated decision-making that results in differential pricing based on personal data or personal characteristics could also have a significant effect if, for example, prohibitively high prices effectively bar someone from certain goods or services. Author Siarhei Varankevich CIPP/E, CIPM, CIPT, MBA, FIP Co-Founder & CEO of Data Privacy Office LLC. Data Protection Trainer and Principal Consultant Ask a question 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if the decision: Expert commentary Expert commentary Paragraph 1 of this article laid down a general ban on the use of automated decision-making that has legal or similarly significant effects (as mentioned above). This prohibition is intended to serve as a safeguard, ensuring that decisions of this kind are not taken without due consideration and oversight. This implies that the controller should not undertake the processing described in Article 22(1) unless one of the exceptions listed below applies. (a) is necessary for entering into, or performance of, a contract between the data subject and a data controller; Expert commentary Expert commentary The use of automated decision-making processes for contractual purposes may be the most appropriate way to achieve the desired outcome in certain situations. This is especially true where routine human involvement is impractical or impossible due to the large volume of data. In such instances, it is essential that the controller is able to demonstrate that the processing is necessary, taking into account whether a less privacy-intrusive method could be employed. For example, if there are alternative methods that are equally effective and less intrusive, then automated decision-making is not considered to be \u2018necessary\u2019. Moreover, automated decision-making may also be necessary for pre-contractual processing in accordance with Article 22(1). It is essential that controllers consider the privacy implications of their automated decision-making processes, ensuring that any processing is necessary and proportionate, and that there are sufficient safeguards in place to protect individuals\u2019 data rights. For instance, it may be necessary to utilize automated decision-making in order to identify a short list of suitable candidates due to the exceptionally high volume of applications received for this open position. This is done with the intention of entering into a contract with the data subject in order to progress the recruitment process. (b) is authorised by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests; or Expert commentary Expert commentary Automated decision-making under 22(2)(b) may be allowed by law, with measures to protect data subject rights. Recital 71 notes potential use for fraud/tax evasion prevention, or service security/reliability. (c) is based on the data subject\u2019s explicit consent. Expert commentary Related Expert commentary Article 22 of the GDPR makes an exception for using explicit consent for significant automated individual decision-making. This is due to the serious privacy risks posed by such processing and, as such, a higher level of individual control over personal data is deemed appropriate. However, \u2018explicit consent\u2019 is not defined in the GDPR. For this reason, the WP29 guidelines on consent (see the \u201cRelated\u201d tab for Art.22(2b)) provide important guidance. These guidelines emphasize that consent must be demonstrated through clear affirmative action, such as ticking a box when visiting an internet website or choosing technical settings for an online service. Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 OBTAINING EXPLICIT CONSENT 93. The term explicit refers to the way consent is expressed by the data subject. It means that the data subject must give an express statement of consent. An obvious way to make sure consent is explicit would be to expressly confirm consent in a written statement. Where appropriate, the controller could make sure the written statement is signed by the data subject, in order to remove all possible doubt and potential lack of evidence in the future.[47] [47] See also WP29 Opinion 15/2011, on the definition of consent (WP 187), p. 25. 94. However, such a signed statement is not the only way to obtain explicit consent and, it cannot be said that the GDPR prescribes written and signed statements in all circumstances that require valid explicit consent. For example, in the digital or online context, a data subject may be able to issue the required statement by filling in an electronic form, by sending an email, by uploading a scanned document carrying the signature of the data subject, or by using an electronic signature. In theory, the use of oral statements can also be sufficiently express to obtain valid explicit consent, however, it may be difficult to prove for the controller that all conditions for valid explicit consent were met when the statement was recorded. 95. An organisation may also obtain explicit consent through a telephone conversation, provided that the information about the choice is fair, intelligible and clear, and it asks for a specific confirmation from the data subject (e.g. pressing a button or providing oral confirmation). 3. In the cases referred to in points (a) and (c) of paragraph 2, the data controller shall implement suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, at least the right to obtain human intervention on the part of the controller, to express his or her point of view and to contest the decision. Expert commentary Expert commentary According to Art29 Working Party Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-Making and Profiling for the Purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (2018) the controllers should implement measures that include providing a way for the data subject to obtain human intervention, express their point of view and contest the decision. Recital 71 further emphasizes the need for transparency around processing, as it outlines that appropriate safeguards should include providing the data subject with specific information and the right to obtain an explanation and to challenge the decision reached after assessment. Furthermore, the controller must provide an easy way for the data subject to exercise these rights, as this ensures they are able to adequately challenge a decision or express their view if they understand how it was made and on what basis. Errors in data or automated decision-making can lead to wrong classifications and inaccurate projections that can harm individuals. So, controllers should regularly assess their data sets to find any bias, and figure out how to handle any prejudiced elements. Data controllers must regularly review algorithms to ensure accuracy and the absence of bias. Furthermore, they should review the underlying data to guarantee that automated decisions are based on valid and reliable information. Controllers should establish regular procedures to prevent errors, inaccuracies, and discrimination during both the design and production stages. The European supervisory authority recommended the following measures in its Guidelines: Ensuring regular QA checks of systems to ensure individuals are treated fairly, without discrimination based on personal data or other factors. Algorithmic auditing that involves testing the algorithms utilized and developed by machine learning systems to validate that they are functioning as intended, and not producing discriminatory, erroneous, or unjustified results. Provide auditor with information on how algorithm/ML system works for independent auditing of the decisions taken. Making sure any third party algorithms you\u2019re using have contractual assurances that they\u2019ve been audited and tested, and are compliant with the agreed standards. Data minimisation and setting clear timelines for using and applying the profiles Utilization of anonymization or pseudonymization Providing data subjects with the opportunity to express his or her point of view and contest the decision; and, Provide a mechanism for human intervention in defined cases (e.g. a link to an appeals process at the point of automated decision delivery). Establish agreed timescales and contact point for any queries.https://gdpr-text.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=288&action=edit 4. Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place.

Lawfulness of processing 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; [\u2026] Article 9 GDPR. Processing of special categories of personal data 1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject; [\u2026] (c) the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(1) and there are no overriding legitimate grounds for the processing, or the data subject objects to the processing pursuant to Article 21(2); Related Related Article 21 GDPR. Right to object 1. The data subject shall have the right to object, on grounds relating to his or her particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her which is based on point (e) or (f) of Article 6(1), including profiling based on those provisions. The controller shall no longer process the personal data unless the controller demonstrates compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override the interests, rights and freedoms of the data subject or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. 2. Where personal data are processed for direct marketing purposes, the data subject shall have the right to object at any time to processing of personal data concerning him or her for such marketing, which includes profiling to the extent that it is related to such direct marketing. [\u2026] (d) the personal data have been unlawfully processed; (e) the personal data have to be erased for compliance with a legal obligation in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject; (f) the personal data have been collected in relation to the offer of information society services referred to in Article 8(1). Related Related 1. Where point (a) of Article 6(1) applies, in relation to the offer of information society services directly to a child, the processing of the personal data of a child shall be lawful where the child is at least 16 years old. Where the child is below the age of 16 years, such processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child. Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. [\u2026] Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Information society service 129. While assessing the scope of this definition, the EDPB also refers to case law of the ECJ.[62] The ECJ held that information society services cover contracts and other services that are concluded or transmitted on-line. Where a service has two economically independent components, one being the online component, such as the offer and the acceptance of an offer in the context of the conclusion of a contract or the information relating to products or services, including marketing activities, this component is defined as an information society service, the other component being the physical delivery or distribution of goods is not covered by the notion of an information society service. The online delivery of a service would fall within the scope of the term information society service in Article 8 GDPR. [62] See European Court of Justice, 2 December 2010 Case C-108/09, (Ker-Optika), paragraphs 22 and 28. In relation to \u2018composite services\u2019, the EDPB also refers to Case C-434/15 (Asociacion Profesional Elite Taxi v Uber Systems Spain SL), para 40, which states that an information society service forming an integral part of an overall service whose main component is not an information society service (in this case a transport service), must not be qualified as \u2018an information society service\u2019. Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to data subjects in the Union The first activity triggering the application of Article 3(2) is the \u201coffering of goods or services\u201d, a concept which has been further addressed by EU law and case law, which should be taken into account when applying the targeting criterion. The offering of services also includes the offering of information society services, defined in point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 [23] as \u201cany Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services\u201d.

Where the controller has made the personal data public and is obliged pursuant to paragraph 1 to erase the personal data, the controller, taking account of available technology and the cost of implementation, shall take reasonable steps, including technical measures, to inform controllers which are processing the personal data that the data subject has requested the erasure by such controllers of any links to, or copy or replication of, those personal data.

Safeguards and derogations relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes 1. Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner. [\u2026] Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Scientific research 153. Recital 33 seems to bring some flexibility to the degree of specification and granularity of consent in the context of scientific research. Recital 33 states: \u201cIt is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.\u201d (e) for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.",

(a) the identity and the contact details of the controller and, where applicable, of the controller\u2019s representative; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2018): This information should allow for easy identification of the controller and preferably allow for different forms of communications with the data controller (e.g. phone number, email, postal address etc.). (b) the contact details of the data protection officer, where applicable; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Data Protection Officers (DPOs) (2017): The contact details of the DPO should include information allowing data subjects and the supervisory authorities to reach the DPO in an easy way (a postal address, a dedicated telephone number, and/or a dedicated e-mail address). When appropriate, for purposes of communications with the public, other means of communications could also be provided, for example, a dedicated hotline, or a dedicated contact form addressed to the DPO on the organisation\u2019s website. Article 37(7) does not require that the published contact details should include the name of the DPO. Whilst it may be a good practice to do so, it is for the controller or the processor and the DPO to decide whether this is necessary or helpful in the particular circumstances. [\u2026] As a matter of good practice, the WP29 also recommends that an organisation informs its employees of the name and contact details of the DPO. For example, the name and contact details of the DPO could be published internally on organisation\u2019s intranet, internal telephone directory, and organisational charts. (c) the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended as well as the legal basis for the processing; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2018): In addition to setting out the purposes of the processing for which the personal data is intended, the relevant legal basis relied upon under Article 6 must be specified. In the case of special categories of personal data, the relevant provision of Article 9 (and where relevant, the applicable Union or Member State law under which the data is processed) should be specified. Where, pursuant to Article 10, personal data relating to criminal convictions and offences or related security measures based on Article 6.1 is processed, where applicable the relevant Union or Member State law under which the processing is carried out should be specified. (d) where the processing is based on point (f) of Article 6(1), the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party; Guidelines & Case Law Related Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): The specific interest in question must be identified for the benefit of the data subject. As a matter of best practice, the controller can also provide the data subject with the information from the balancing test, which must be carried out to allow reliance on Article 6.1(f) as a lawful basis for processing, in advance of any collection of data subjects\u2019 personal data. To avoid information fatigue, this can be included within a layered privacy statement/ notice (see paragraph 35). In any case, the WP29 position is that information to the data subject should make it clear that they can obtain information on the balancing test upon request. This is essential for effective transparency where data subjects have doubts as to whether the balancing test has been carried out fairly or they wish to file a complaint with a supervisory authority. Related Article 6 GDPR. Lawfulness of processing [\u2026] 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: [\u2026] (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. (e) the recipients or categories of recipients of the personal data, if any; Guidelines & Case Law Related Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): The term \u201crecipient\u201d is defined in Article 4.9 as \u201ca natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not\u201d [emphasis added]. As such, a recipient does not have to be a third party. Therefore, other data controllers, joint controllers and processors to whom data is transferred or disclosed are covered by the term \u201crecipient\u201d and information on such recipients should be provided in addition to information on third party recipients. The actual (named) recipients of the personal data, or the categories of recipients, must be provided. In accordance with the principle of fairness, controllers must provide information on the recipients that is most meaningful for data subjects. In practice, this will generally be the named recipients, so that data subjects know exactly who has their personal data. If controllers opt to provide the categories of recipients, the information should be as specific as possible by indicating the type of recipient (i.e. by reference to the activities it carries out), the industry, sector and sub-sector and the location of the recipients. Related Article 4 GDPR. Definitions Definitions [\u2026] (9) \u2018recipient\u2019 means a natural or legal person, public authority, agency or another body, to which the personal data are disclosed, whether a third party or not. However, public authorities which may receive personal data in the framework of a particular inquiry in accordance with Union or Member State law shall not be regarded as recipients; the processing of those data by those public authorities shall be in compliance with the applicable data protection rules according to the purposes of the processing; [\u2026] (f) where applicable, the fact that the controller intends to transfer personal data to a third country or international organisation and the existence or absence of an adequacy decision by the Commission, or in the case of transfers referred to in Article 46 or 47, or the second subparagraph of Article 49(1), reference to the appropriate or suitable safeguards and the means by which to obtain a copy of them or where they have been made available. Guidelines & Case Law Related Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): The relevant GDPR article permitting the transfer and the corresponding mechanism (e.g. adequacy decision under Article 45/ binding corporate rules under Article 47/ standard data protection clauses under Article 46.2/ derogations and safeguards under Article 49 etc.) should be specified. Information on where and how the relevant document may be accessed or obtained should also be provided e.g. by providing a link to the mechanism used. In accordance with the principle of fairness, the information provided on transfers to third countries should be as meaningful as possible to data subjects; this will generally mean that the third countries be named. Related Article 45 GDPR. Transfers on the basis of an adequacy decision Article 47 GDPR. Binding corporate rules Article 46 GDPR. Transfers subject to appropriate safeguards [\u2026] 2. The appropriate safeguards referred to in paragraph 1 may be provided for, without requiring any specific authorisation from a supervisory authority, by: (b) binding corporate rules in accordance with Article 47; (c) standard data protection clauses adopted by the Commission in accordance with the examination procedure referred to in Article 93(2); [\u2026] Article 49 GDPR. Derogations for specific situations 1. In the absence of an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45(3), or of appropriate safeguards pursuant to Article 46, including binding corporate rules, a transfer or a set of transfers of personal data to a third country or an international organisation shall take place only on one of the following conditions: [\u2026] Where a transfer could not be based on a provision in Article 45 or 46, including the provisions on binding corporate rules, and none of the derogations for a specific situation referred to in the first subparagraph of this paragraph is applicable, a transfer to a third country or an international organisation may take place only if the transfer is not repetitive, concerns only a limited number of data subjects, is necessary for the purposes of compelling legitimate interests pursued by the controller which are not overridden by the interests or rights and freedoms of the data subject, and the controller has assessed all the circumstances surrounding the data transfer and has on the basis of that assessment provided suitable safeguards with regard to the protection of personal data. The controller shall inform the supervisory authority of the transfer. The controller shall, in addition to providing the information referred to in Articles 13 and 14, inform the data subject of the transfer and on the compelling legitimate interests pursued. [\u2026] 2. In addition to the information referred to in paragraph 1, the controller shall, at the time when personal data are obtained, provide the data subject with the following further information necessary to ensure fair and transparent processing: Recitals Related Recitals (61) The information in relation to the processing of personal data relating to the data subject should be given to him or her at the time of collection from the data subject, or, where the personal data are obtained from another source, within a reasonable period, depending on the circumstances of the case. Where personal data can be legitimately disclosed to another recipient, the data subject should be informed when the personal data are first disclosed to the recipient. Where the controller intends to process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which they were collected, the controller should provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and other necessary information. Where the origin of the personal data cannot be provided to the data subject because various sources have been used, general information should be provided. Related Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 3.1 Transparency [24] [24]Elaboration on how to understand the concept of transparency can be found in Article 29 Working Party. \u201cGuidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679\u201d.

The controller must be clear and open with the data subject about how they will collect, use and share personal data. Transparency is about enabling data subjects to understand, and if necessary, make use of their rights in Articles 15 to 22. The principle is embedded in Articles 12, 13, 14 and 34. Measures and safeguards put in place to support the principle of transparency should also support the implementation of these Articles. 66. Key design and default elements for the principle of transparency may include: \u2022Clarity \u2013 Information shall be in clear and plain language, concise and intelligible. \u2022Semantics \u2013 Communication should have a clear meaning to the audience in question. \u2022Accessibility \u2013 Information shall be easily accessible for the data subject. \u2022Contextual \u2013 Information should be provided at the relevant time and in the appropriate form. \u2022Relevance \u2013 Information should be relevant and applicable to the specific data subject. \u2022Universal design \u2013 Information shall be accessible to all data subjects, include use of machine readable languages to facilitate and automate readability and clarity. \u2022Comprehensible \u2013 Data subjects should have a fair understanding of what they can expect with regards to the processing of their personal data, particularly when the data subjects are children or other vulnerable groups. \u2022 Multi-channel \u2013 Information should be provided in different channels and media, not only the textual, to increase the probability for the information to effectively reach the data subject. \u2022 Layered \u2013 The information should be layered in a manner that resolves the tension between completeness and understanding, while accounting for data subjects\u2019 reasonable expectations. (a) the period for which the personal data will be stored, or if that is not possible, the criteria used to determine that period; ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 13(2)(a) GDPR: 7.4.7 Retention Control The organization should not retain PII for longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the PII is processed. Implementation guidance The organization should develop and maintain retention schedules for information it retains, taking into account the requirement to retain PII for no longer than is necessary. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): This is linked to the data minimisation requirement in Article 5.1(c) and storage limitation requirement in Article 5.1(e). The storage period (or criteria to determine it) may be dictated by factors such as statutory requirements or industry guidelines but should be phrased in a way that allows the data subject to assess, on the basis of his or her own situation, what the retention period will be for specific data/ purposes. It is not sufficient for the data controller to generically state that personal data will be kept as long as necessary for the legitimate purposes of the processing. Where relevant, the different storage periods should be stipulated for different categories of personal data and/or different processing purposes, including where appropriate, archiving periods. EDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020): Storage limitation should consider the true needs and the medical relevance (this may include epidemiology-motivated considerations like the incubation period,etc.) and personal data should be kept only for the duration of the COVID-19 crisis. Afterwards,as a general rule,all personal data should be erased or anonymised. (b) the existence of the right to request from the controller access to and rectification or erasure of personal data or restriction of processing concerning the data subject or to object to processing as well as the right to data portability; ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraphs to article 13(2)(b) GDPR: 7.3.5 Providing mechanism to object to PII processing Control The organization should provide a mechanism for PII principals to object to the processing of their PII. Implementation guidance Some jurisdictions provide PII principals with a right to object to the processing of their PII. Organizations subject to the legislation and/or regulation of such jurisdictions should ensure that they implement appropriate measures to enable PII principals to exercize this right. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): This information should be specific to the processing scenario and include a summary of what the right involves and how the data subject can take steps to exercise it and any limitations on the right. [\u2026] In particular, the right to object to processing must be explicitly brought to the data subject\u2019s attention at the latest at the time of first communication with the data subject and must be presented clearly and separately from any other information.64 In relation to the right to portability, see WP29 Guidelines on the right to data portability. (c) where the processing is based on point (a) of Article 6(1) or point (a) of Article 9(2), the existence of the right to withdraw consent at any time, without affecting the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal; ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 13(2)(c) GDPR: 7.3.4 Providing mechanism to modify or withdraw consent Control The organization should provide a mechanism for PII principals to modify or withdraw their consent. Implementation guidance The organization should inform PII principals of their rights related to withdrawing consent (which may vary by jurisdiction) at any time, and provide the mechanism to do so. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): This information should include how consent may be withdrawn, taking into account that it should be as easy for a data subject to withdraw consent as to give it. Related Article 6 GDPR. Lawfulness of processing Lawfulness of processing 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; [\u2026] Article 9 GDPR. Processing of special categories of personal data Processing of special categories of personal data 1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject; [\u2026] Article 7 GDPR. Conditions for consent Conditions for consent [\u2026] 3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. [\u2026] Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 3.2 Lawfulness 67. The controller must identify a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data.

(d) the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority; Guidelines & Case Law Related Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): This information should explain that, in accordance with Article 77, a data subject has the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or of an alleged infringement of the GDPR. Related Article 77 GDPR. Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority Right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority 1. Without prejudice to any other administrative or judicial remedy, every data subject shall have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, in particular in the Member State of his or her habitual residence, place of work or place of the alleged infringement if the data subject considers that the processing of personal data relating to him or her infringes this Regulation. 2. The supervisory authority with which the complaint has been lodged shall inform the complainant on the progress and the outcome of the complaint including the possibility of a judicial remedy pursuant to Article 78. (e) whether the provision of personal data is a statutory or contractual requirement, or a requirement necessary to enter into a contract, as well as whether the data subject is obliged to provide the personal data and of the possible consequences of failure to provide such data; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679, WP260 rev.01 (2016): For example in an employment context, it may be a contractual requirement to provide certain information to a current or prospective employer. Online forms should clearly identify which fields are \u201crequired\u201d, which are not, and what will be the consequences of not filling in the required fields. (f) the existence of automated decision-making, including profiling, referred to in Article 22(1) and (4) and, at least in those cases, meaningful information about the logic involved, as well as the significance and the envisaged consequences of such processing for the data subject. ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 13(2)(f) GDPR: 7.3.10 Automated decision making Control The organization should identify and address obligations, including legal obligations, to the PII principals resulting from decisions made by the organization which are related to the PII principal based solely on automated processing of PII. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (wp251rev.01) (2018): Given the core principle of transparency underpinning the GDPR, controllers must ensure they explain clearly and simply to individuals how the profiling or automated decision-making process works. In particular, where the processing involves profiling-based decision making (irrespective of whether it is caught by Article 22 provisions), then the fact that the processing is for the purposes of both (a) profiling and (b) making a decision based on the profile generated, must be made clear to the data subject. Recital 60 states that giving information about profiling is part of the controller\u2019s transparency obligations under Article 5(1) (a). The data subject has a right to be informed by the controller about and, in certain circumstances, a right to object to \u2018profiling\u2019, regardless of whether solely automated individual decision-making based on profiling takes place. EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020). Related Article 22 GDPR. Automated individual decision-making, including profiling 1. The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. [\u2026] 4. Decisions referred to in paragraph 2 shall not be based on special categories of personal data referred to in Article 9(1), unless point (a) or (g) of Article 9(2) applies and suitable measures to safeguard the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests are in place. 3. Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were collected, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2.

Processing of special categories of personal data 1. Processing of personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation shall be prohibited. [\u2026] 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject; [\u2026] Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 3.2 Lawfulness 67.

The data subject shall have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning him or her or similarly significantly affects him or her. Article 4 GDPR. Definitions For the purposes of this Regulation: [\u2026] (4) \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements; [\u2026] 3. The controller shall provide the information referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2: (a) within a reasonable period after obtaining the personal data, but at the latest within one month, having regard to the specific circumstances in which the personal data are processed; (b) if the personal data are to be used for communication with the data subject, at the latest at the time of the first communication to that data subject; or (c) if a disclosure to another recipient is envisaged, at the latest when the personal data are first disclosed. 4. Where the controller intends to further process the personal data for a purpose other than that for which the personal data were obtained, the controller shall provide the data subject prior to that further processing with information on that other purpose and with any relevant further information as referred to in paragraph 2. 5. Paragraphs 1 to 4 shall not apply where and insofar as: (a) the data subject already has the information; (b) the provision of such information proves impossible or would involve a disproportionate effort, in particular for processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in Article 89(1) or in so far as the obligation referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article is likely to render impossible or seriously impair the achievement of the objectives of that processing. In such cases the controller shall take appropriate measures to protect the data subject\u2019s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, including making the information publicly available; Related Related Article 89 GDPR. Safeguards and derogations relating to processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes 1. Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation. Those measures may include pseudonymisation provided that those purposes can be fulfilled in that manner. Where those purposes can be fulfilled by further processing which does not permit or no longer permits the identification of data subjects, those purposes shall be fulfilled in that manner. [\u2026] Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 \u201cProves impossible\u201d The situation where it \u201cproves impossible\u201d under Article 14.5(b) to provide the information is an all or nothing situation because something is either impossible or it is not; there are no degrees of impossibility. Thus if a data controller seeks to rely on this exemption it must demonstrate the factors that actually prevent it from providing the information in question to data subjects. If, after a certain period of time, the factors that caused the \u201cimpossibility\u201d no longer exist and it becomes possible to provide the information to data subjects then the data controller should immediately do so. In practice, there will be very few situations in which a data controller can demonstrate that it is actually impossible to provide the information to data subjects. The following example demonstrates this. Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 \u201cDisproportionate effort\u201d In determining what may constitute either impossibility or disproportionate effort under Article 14.5(b), it is relevant that there are no comparable exemptions under Article 13 (where personal data is collected from a data subject). The only difference between an Article 13 and an Article 14 situation is that in the latter, the personal data is not collected from the data subject. It therefore follows that impossibility or disproportionate effort typically arises by virtue of circumstances which do not apply if the personal data is collected from the data subject. In other words, the impossibility or disproportionate effort must be directly connected to the fact that the personal data was obtained other than from the data subject. Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Scientific research 153. Recital 33 seems to bring some flexibility to the degree of specification and granularity of consent in the context of scientific research. Recital 33 states: \u201cIt is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose.\u201d (c) obtaining or disclosure is expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which provides appropriate measures to protect the data subject\u2019s legitimate interests; or Related Related Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 The factors referred to above in Recital 62 (number of data subjects, the age of the data and any appropriate safeguards adopted) may be indicative of the types of issues that contribute to a data controller having to use disproportionate effort to notify a data subject of the relevant Article 14 information. Article 14.5(c) allows for a lifting of the information requirements in Articles 14.1, 14.2 and 14.4 insofar as the obtaining or disclosure of personal data \u201cis expressly laid down by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject\u201d. This exemption is conditional upon the law in question providing \u201cappropriate measures to protect the data subject\u2019s legitimate interests\u201d. Such a law must directly address the data controller and the obtaining or disclosure in question should be mandatory upon the data controller. Accordingly, the data controller must be able to demonstrate how the law in question applies to them and requires them to either obtain or disclose the personal data in question. While it is for Union or Member State law to frame the law such that it provides \u201cappropriate measures to protect the data subject\u2019s legitimate interests\u201d, the data controller should ensure (and be able to demonstrate) that its obtaining or disclosure of personal data complies with those measures. Furthermore, the data controller should make it clear to data subjects that it obtains or discloses personal data in accordance with the law in question, unless there is a legal prohibition preventing the data controller from doing so. This is in line with Recital 41 of the GDPR, which states that a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise, and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU and the European Court of Human Rights. However, Article 14.5(c) will not apply where the data controller is under an obligation to obtain data directly from a data subject, in which case Article 13 will apply. In that case, the only exemption under the GDPR exempting the controller from providing the data subject with information on the processing will be that under Article 13.4 (i.e. where and insofar as the data subject already has the information). However, as referred to below at paragraph 68, at a national level, Member States may also legislate, in accordance with Article 23, for further specific restrictions to the right to transparency under Article 12 and to information under Articles 13 and 14. (d) where the personal data must remain confidential subject to an obligation of professional secrecy regulated by Union or Member State law, including a statutory obligation of secrecy.",

In most cases, this is the ad network provider. When publishers are joint-controllers, for example in those cases where they transfer directly identifiable information to ad network providers, they are also bound by the obligation to provide information to data subjects about the data processing. Recitals (58) The principle of transparency requires that any information addressed to the public or to the data subject be concise, easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language and, additionally, where appropriate, visualisation be used. Such information could be provided in electronic form, for example, when addressed to the public, through a website. This is of particular relevance in situations where the proliferation of actors and the technological complexity of practice make it difficult for the data subject to know and understand whether, by whom and for what purpose personal data relating to him or her are being collected, such as in the case of online advertising. Given that children merit specific protection, any information and communication, where processing is addressed to a child, should be in such a clear and plain language that the child can easily understand.

Key design and default elements for the principle of transparency may include: \u2022Clarity \u2013 Information shall be in clear and plain language, concise and intelligible. \u2022Semantics \u2013 Communication should have a clear meaning to the audience in question. \u2022Accessibility \u2013 Information shall be easily accessible for the data subject. \u2022Contextual \u2013 Information should be provided at the relevant time and in the appropriate form. \u2022Relevance \u2013 Information should be relevant and applicable to the specific data subject. \u2022Universal design \u2013 Information shall be accessible to all data subjects, include use of machine readable languages to facilitate and automate readability and clarity. \u2022Comprehensible \u2013 Data subjects should have a fair understanding of what they can expect with regards to the processing of their personal data, particularly when the data subjects are children or other vulnerable groups. \u2022 Multi-channel \u2013 Information should be provided in different channels and media, not only the textual, to increase the probability for the information to effectively reach the data subject. \u2022 Layered \u2013 The information should be layered in a manner that resolves the tension between completeness and understanding, while accounting for data subjects\u2019 reasonable expectations. Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 \u201cConcise, transparent, intelligible and easily accessible\u201d The requirement that the provision of information to, and communication with, data subjects is done in a \u201cconcise and transparent\u201d manner means that data controllers should present the information/ communication efficiently and succinctly in order to avoid information fatigue. This information should be clearly differentiated from other non-privacy related information such as contractual provisions or general terms of use. In an online context, the use of a layered privacy statement/ notice will enable a data subject to navigate to the particular section of the privacy statement/ notice which they want to immediately access rather than having to scroll through large amounts of text searching for particular issues. The \u201ceasily accessible\u201d element means that the data subject should not have to seek out the information; it should be immediately apparent to them where and how this information can be accessed, for example by providing it directly to them, by linking them to it, by clearly signposting it or as an answer to a natural language question (for example in an online layered privacy statement/ notice, in FAQs, by way of contextual pop-ups which activate when a data subject fills in an online form, or in an interactive digital context through a chatbot interface, etc. These mechanisms are further considered below, including at paragraphs 33 to 40). \u201cClear and plain language\u201d With written information (and where written information is delivered orally, or by audio/ audiovisual methods, including for vision-impaired data subjects), best practices for clear writing should be followed.11 A similar language requirement (for \u201cplain, intelligible language\u201d) has previously been used by the EU legislator12 and is also explicitly referred to in the context of consent in Recital 42 of the GDPR13. The requirement for clear and plain language means that information should be provided in as simple a manner as possible, avoiding complex sentence and language structures. The information should be concrete and definitive; it should not be phrased in abstract or ambivalent terms or leave room for different interpretations. In particular the purposes of, and legal basis for, processing the personal data should be clear. \u201cIn writing or by other means\u201d Of course, the use of digital layered privacy statements/ notices is not the only written electronic means that can be deployed by controllers. Other electronic means include \u201cjustin-time\u201d contextual pop-up notices, 3D touch or hover-over notices, and privacy dashboards. Non-written electronic means which may be used in addition to a layered privacy statement/ notice might include videos and smartphone or IoT voice alerts.[25] \u201cOther means\u201d, which are not necessarily electronic, might include, for example, cartoons, infographics or flowcharts. Where transparency information is directed at children specifically, controllers should consider what types of measures may be particularly accessible to children (e.g. these might be comics/ cartoons, pictograms, animations, etc. amongst other measures). 2. The controller shall facilitate the exercise of data subject rights under Articles 15 to 22. In the cases referred to in Article 11(2), the controller shall not refuse to act on the request of the data subject for exercising his or her rights under Articles 15 to 22, unless the controller demonstrates that it is not in a position to identify the data subject. ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 12(2) GDPR: 7.3.1 Determining and fulfilling obligations to PII principals Control The organization should determine and document their legal, regulatory and business obligations to PII principals related to the processing of their PII and provide the means to meet these obligations.

In such cases, Articles 15 to 20 shall not apply except where the data subject, for the purpose of exercising his or her rights under those articles, provides additional information enabling his or her identification. 3. The controller shall provide information on action taken on a request under Articles 15 to 22 to the data subject without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the request. That period may be extended by two further months where necessary, taking into account the complexity and number of the requests. The controller shall inform the data subject of any such extension within one month of receipt of the request, together with the reasons for the delay.

Personal data shall be: (a) processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (\u2018lawfulness, fairness and transparency\u2019); Expert commentary ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Related Expert commentary Example of lawful processing: Example A bank plans to offer a service to improve efficiency in the management of loan applications. The idea behind the service is that the bank, by requesting permission from the customer, can be able to retrieve data from public authorities about the customer. This may be, for example, tax data from the tax administration. Initially, this personal data is necessary in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. However, this specific way of processing the personal data is not necessary for entering into a contract, because a loan may be granted without obtaining data directly from public authorities. The customer is able to enter into a contract by providing the information from the tax administration herself. When implementing the principle of lawfulness, the controller realizes that they cannot use the \u201cnecessary for contract-\u201dbasis for the part of the processing that involves gathering personal data directly from the tax authorities. The fact that this specific processing presents a risk of the data subject becoming less involved in the processing of their data is also a relevant factor in assessing the lawfulness of the processing itself. The bank concludes that this part of the processing must rely on consent. The bank therefore presents information about the processing on the online application platform in such a manner that makes it easy for data subjects to understand what processing is mandatory and what is optional. The processing options, by default, do not allow retrieval of data directly from other sources than the data subject herself, and the option for direct information retrieval is presented in a manner that does not deter the data subject from abstaining. Any consent given to collect data directly from other controllers is a temporary right of access to a specific set of information. Any given consent is processed electronically in a documentable manner, and data subjects are presented with an easy way of controlling what they have consented to and to withdraw their consent. The controller has assessed these Data protection by design and default (DPbDD) requirements beforehand and includes all of these criteria in their requirements specification for the tender to procure the platform. The controller is aware that if they do not include the DPbDD requirements in the tender, it may either be too late or a very costly process to implement data protection afterwards. Source: EDPB, Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 \u2013 Data Protection by Design and by Default (Version for public consultation) (2019). Example of transparency measures: A controller is designing a privacy policy in order to comply with the requirements of transparency. The privacy policy cannot contain a lengthy bulk of information that is difficult for the average data subject to penetrate and understand, it must be written in clear and concise language and make it easy for the user of the website to understand how their personal data is processed. The controller therefore provides information in a multi-layered manner, where the most important points are highlighted. Drop-down menus and links to other pages are provided to further explain the concepts in the policy. The controller also makes sure that the information is provided in a multi-channel manner, providing video clips to explain the most important points of the information. The privacy policy cannot be difficult for data subjects to access. The privacy policy is thus made available and visible on all internal web-pages of the site in question, so that the data subject is always only one click away from accessing the information. The information provided is also designed in accordance with the best practices and standards of universal design to make it accessible to all. Moreover, necessary information must also be provided in the right context, at the appropriate time. This means, that generally a privacy policy on the website alone is not sufficient for the controller to meet the requirements of transparency. The controller therefore designs an information flow, presenting the data subject with relevant information within the appropriate contexts using e.g. informational snippets or pop-ups. For example, when asking the data subject to enter personal data, the controller informs the data subject of how the personal data will be processed and why that personal data is necessary for the processing. Source: EDPB, Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 \u2013 Data Protection by Design and by Default (Version for public consultation) (2019). Examples of fairness considerations: Example 1 A controller operates a search engine that processes mostly user-generated personal data. The controller benefits from having large amounts of personal data and being able to use that personal data for targeted advertisements. The controller therefore wishes to influence data subjects to allow extensive collection and use of their personal data. When implementing the fairness principle, taking into account the nature, scope, context and purpose of the processing, the controller realizes that they cannot present the options in a way that nudges the data subject in the direction of allowing the controller to collect more personal data than if the options were presented in an equal and neutral way. This means that they cannot present the processing options in such a manner that makes it difficult for data subjects to abstain from sharing their data, or make it difficult for the data subjects to adjust their privacy settings and limit the processing. The default options for the processing must be the least invasive, and the choice for further processing must be presented in a manner that does not deter the data subject from abstaining. Example 2 Another controller processes personal data for the provision of a streaming service where users may choose between a regular subscription of standard quality and a premium subscription with higher quality. As part of the premium subscription, subscribers get prioritized customer service. With regard to the fairness principle, the prioritized customer service granted to premium subscribers cannot discriminate other data subjects\u2019 rights according to the GDPR Article 12. This means that although the premium subscribers get prioritized service, such prioritization cannot result in a lack of appropriate measures to respond to request from regular subscribers without undue delay and in any event within one month of receipt of the requests. Prioritized customers may pay to get better service, but all data subjects shall have equal and indiscriminate access to enforce their rights and freedoms according to the GDPR.

ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 5(1)(a) GDPR: 7.2.2 Identify lawful basis Control The organization should determine, document and comply with the relevant lawful basis for the processing of PII for the identified purposes. Implementation guidance Some jurisdictions require the organization to be able to demonstrate that the lawfulness of processing was duly established before the processing. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Guidelines & Case Law EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020). Recitals (39) Any processing of personal data should be lawful and fair. It should be transparent to natural persons that personal data concerning them are collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed and to what extent the personal data are or will be processed. The principle of transparency requires that any information and communication relating to the processing of those personal data be easily accessible and easy to understand, and that clear and plain language be used. That principle concerns, in particular, information to the data subjects on the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing and further information to ensure fair and transparent processing in respect of the natural persons concerned and their right to obtain confirmation and communication of personal data concerning them which are being processed. Natural persons should be made aware of risks, rules, safeguards and rights in relation to the processing of personal data and how to exercise their rights in relation to such processing. In particular, the specific purposes for which personal data are processed should be explicit and legitimate and determined at the time of the collection of the personal data. The personal data should be adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purposes for which they are processed. This requires, in particular, ensuring that the period for which the personal data are stored is limited to a strict minimum. Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means. In order to ensure that the personal data are not kept longer than necessary, time limits should be established by the controller for erasure or for a periodic review. Every reasonable step should be taken to ensure that personal data which are inaccurate are rectified or deleted. Personal data should be processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security and confidentiality of the personal data, including for preventing unauthorised access to or use of personal data and the equipment used for the processing. Related Article 6 GDPR. Lawfulness of processing 1. Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child.

Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 3.3 Fairness 69. Fairness is an overarching principle which requires that personal data should not be processed in a way that is unjustifiably detrimental, unlawfully discriminatory, unexpected or misleading to the data subject. Measures and safeguards implementing the principle of fairness also support the rights and freedoms of data subjects, specifically the right to information (transparency), the right to intervene (access, erasure, data portability, rectify) and the right to limit the processing (right not to be subject to automated individual decision-making and non-discrimination of data subjects in such processes). 70. Key design and default elements may include: \u2022 Autonomy \u2013 Data subjects should be granted the highest degree of autonomy possible to determine the use made of their personal data, as well as over the scope and conditions of that use or processing. \u2022 Interaction \u2013 Data subjects must be able to communicate and exercise their rights in respect of the personal data processed by the controller. \u2022 Expectation \u2013 Processing should correspond with data subjects\u2019 reasonable expectations. \u2022 Non-discrimination \u2013 The controller shall not unfairly discriminate against data subjects. \u2022 Non-exploitation \u2013 The controller shall not exploit the needs or vulnerabilities of data subjects. \u2022 Consumer choice \u2013 The controller should not \u201clock in\u201d their users in an unfair manner. Whenever a service processing personal data is proprietary, it may create a lock-in to the service, which may not be fair, if it impairs the data subjects\u2019 possibility to exercise their right of data portability in accordance with Article 20. \u2022 Power balance \u2013 Power balance should be a key objective of the controller-data subject relationship.

When this is not possible, they should be recognised and accounted for with suitable countermeasures. \u2022 No risk transfer \u2013 Controllers should not transfer the risks of the enterprise to the data subjects. \u2022 No deception \u2013 Data processing information and options should be provided in an objective and neutral way, avoiding any deceptive or manipulative language or design. \u2022 Respect rights \u2013 The controller must respect the fundamental rights of data subjects and implement appropriate measures and safeguards and not impinge on those rights unless expressly justified by law. \u2022 Ethical \u2013 The controller should see the processing\u2019s wider impact on individuals\u2019 rights and dignity. \u2022 Truthful \u2013 The controller must make available information about how they process personal data, they should act as they declare they will and not mislead the data subjects. \u2022 Human intervention \u2013 The controller must incorporate qualified human intervention that is capable of uncovering biases that machines may create in accordance with the right to not be subject to automated individual decision making in Article 22.[32] [32] See Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679. https://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/article29/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=49826 \u2022 Fair algorithms \u2013 Regularly assess whether algorithms are functioning in line with the purposes and adjust the algorithms to mitigate uncovered biases and ensure fairness in the processing.

The purpose of the processing is to fulfil a contract, i.e. to be able to deliver goods to the correct address and obtain payment. The personal data stored is the purchase history, name, address, e-mail address and telephone number. The controller is considering buying a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) product that gathers all the customer data such as sales, marketing and customer service in one place. The product gives the opportunity of storing all phone calls, activities, documents, emails and marketing campaigns to get a 360-degree view of the customer. Ultimately the CRM automatically analyses the customers\u2019 purchasing power by using public information. The purpose of the analysis is to target the advertising better but is not a part of the original lawful purpose of the processing. To be in line with the principle of purpose limitation, the controller requires the provider of the product to map the different processing activities using personal data with the purposes relevant for the controller. Another requirement is that the product shall be able to flag which kind of processing activities using personal data that is not in line with the legitimate purposes of the controller. After receiving the results of the mapping, the controller assesses whether the new marketing purpose and the targeted advertisement purpose are within the contractual purposes or if they need another legal ground for this processing. Alternatively the controller could choose to not make use of this functionality in the product.

Processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, shall be subject to appropriate safeguards, in accordance with this Regulation, for the rights and freedoms of the data subject. Those safeguards shall ensure that technical and organisational measures are in place in particular in order to ensure respect for the principle of data minimisation.

The controller must collect data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and not further process the data in a manner that is incompatible with the purposes for which they were collected.[35] The design of the processing should therefore be shaped by what is necessary to achieve the purposes. If any further processing is to take place, the controller must first make sure that this processing has purposes compatible with the original ones and design such processing accordingly. Whether a new purpose is compatible or not, shall be assessed according to the criteria in Article 6(4). [35] Art. 5.1.b GDPR (c) adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (\u2018data minimisation\u2019); Expert commentary ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Related Expert commentary Examples of data minimisation Example 1 A bookshop wants to add to their revenue by selling their books online. The bookshop owner wants to set up a standardised form for the ordering process. To prevent that customers don\u2019t fill out all the necessary information the bookshop owner makes all of the fields in the form a required field (if you don\u2019t fill out all the fields the customer can\u2019t place the order) using a standard contact form. The webshop owner initially uses a standard contact form, which asks the customer\u2019s date of birth, phone number and home address. However, not all the fields in the form are strictly necessary for the purpose of buying and delivering the books. The data subject\u2019s date of birth and phone number are not necessary for the purchase of the product. This means that these cannot be required fields in the web form to order the product. Moreover, there are situations where an address will not be necessary. For example, when ordering an eBook the customer can download the product and his or her address does not need to be processed by the webshop. The webshop owner therefore decides to make two web forms: one for ordering books, with a field for the customer\u2019s address and one web form for ordering eBooks without a field for the customer\u2019s address. Example 2 A public transportation company wishes to gather statistical information based on travellers\u2019 routes. This is useful for the purposes of making proper choices on changes in public transport schedules and proper routings of the trains. The passengers must pass their ticket through a reader every time they enter or exit a means of transport. Having carried out a risk assessment related to the rights and freedoms of passengers\u2019 regarding the collection of passengers\u2019 travel routes, the controller establishes that it is possible to identify the passengers based on the ticket identifier. Therefore, since it is not necessary for the purpose of optimizing the public transport schedules and routings of the trains, the controller does not store the ticket identifier. Once the trip is over, the controller only stores the individual travel routes so as to not be able to identify trips connected to a single ticket, but only retains information about separate travel routes. In cases where there can be a risk of identifying a person solely by their travel route (this might be the case in remote areas) the controller implements measures to aggregate the travel route, such as cutting the beginning and the end of the route. Example 3 A courier aims at assessing the effectiveness of its deliveries in terms of delivery times, workload scheduling and fuel consumption. In order to reach this goal, the courier has to process a number of personal data relating to both employees (drivers) and customers (addresses, items to be delivered, etc.). This processing operation entails risks of both monitoring employees, which requires specific legal safeguards, and tracking customers\u2019 habits through the knowledge of the delivered items over time. These risks can be significantly reduced with appropriate pseudonymization of employees and customers. In particular if pseudonymization keys are frequently rotated and macro areas are considered instead of detailed addresses, an effective data minimization is pursued, and the controller can solely focus on the delivery process and on the purpose of resource optimization, without crossing the threshold of monitoring individuals\u2019 (customers\u2019 or employees\u2019) behaviours.

ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraphs to article 5(1)(c) GDPR: 7.4.1 Limit collection Control The organization should limit the collection of PII to the minimum that is relevant, proportional and necessary for the identified purposes. Implementation guidance The organization should limit the collection of PII to what is adequate, relevant and necessary in relation to the identified purposes. This includes limiting the amount of PII that the organization collects indirectly (e.g. through web logs, system logs, etc.). Privacy by default implies that, where any optionality in the collection and processing of PII exists, each option should be disabled by default and only enabled by explicit choice of the PII principal. 7.4.4 PII minimization objectives Control The organization should define and document data minimization objectives and what mechanisms (such as de-identification) are used to meet those objectives.

Related Guidelines 4/2019 on Article 25 Data Protection by Design and by Default Version 2.0. 3.5 Data Minimisation 73. Only personal data that is adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary for the purpose shall be processed. [36] As a result, the controller has to predetermine which features and parameters of processing systems and their supporting functions are permissible. Data minimisation substantiates and operationalises the principle of necessity. In the further processing, the controller should periodically consider whether processed personal data is still adequate, relevant and necessary, or if the data shall be deleted or anonymized. [36] Art. 5(1)(c) GDPR 74. Controllers should first of all determine whether they even need to process personal data for their relevant purposes. The controller should verify whether the relevant purposes can be achieved by processing less personal data, or having less detailed or aggregated personal data or without having to process personal data at all.[37] Such verification should take place before any processing takes place, but could also be carried out at any point during the processing lifecycle. This is also consistent with Article 11. [37] Recital 39 GDPR so states: \u201c\u2026Personal data should be processed only if the purpose of the processing could not reasonably be fulfilled by other means.\u201d 75. Minimising can also refer to the degree of identification. If the purpose of the processing does not require the final set of data to refer to an identified or identifiable individual (such as in statistics), but the initial processing does (e.g. before data aggregation), then the controller shall delete or anonymize personal data as soon as identification is no longer needed. Or, if continued identification is needed for other processing activities, personal data should be pseudonymized to mitigate risks for the data subjects\u2019 rights. 76. Key design and default data minimisation elements may include: \u2022 Data avoidance \u2013 Avoid processing personal data altogether when this is possible for the relevant purpose. \u2022 Limitation \u2013 Limit the amount of personal data collected to what is necessary for the purpose \u2022 Access limitation \u2013 Shape the data processing in a way that a minimal number of people need access to personal data to perform their duties, and limit access accordingly. \u2022 Relevance \u2013 Personal data should be relevant to the processing in question, and the controller should be able to demonstrate this relevance. \u2022 Necessity \u2013 Each personal data category shall be necessary for the specified purposes and should only be processed if it is not possible to fulfil the purpose by other means. \u2022 Limitation \u2013 Limit the amount of personal data collected to what is necessary for the purpose \u2022 Aggregation \u2013 Use aggregated data when possible. \u2022 Pseudonymization \u2013 Pseudonymize personal data as soon as it is no longer necessary to have directly identifiable personal data, and store identification keys separately. \u2022 Anonymization and deletion \u2013 Where personal data is not, or no longer necessary for the purpose, personal data shall be anonymized or deleted. \u2022 Data flow \u2013 The data flow should be made efficient enough to not create more copies than necessary. \u2022 \u201cState of the art\u201d \u2013 The controller should apply up to date and appropriate technologies for data avoidance and minimisation. (d) accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (\u2018accuracy\u2019); Expert commentary ISO 27701 Related Expert commentary Examples of the measures ensuring data accuracy Example 1 A bank wishes to use artificial intelligence (AI) to profile customers applying for bank loans as a basis for their decision making. When determining how their AI solutions should be developed, they are determining the means of processing and must consider data protection by design when choosing an AI from a vendor and when deciding on how to train the AI. When determining how to train the AI, the controller must have accurate data to achieve precise results. Therefore, the controller must ensure that the data used to train the AI is accurate. Granted they have the legal basis to train the AI using personal data from a large pool of their existing customers, the controller chooses a pool of customers that is representative of the population to also avoid bias. Customer data is gathered from their own systems, gathering data about the existing loan customers\u2019 payment history, bank transactions, credit card debt, they conduct new credit checks, and they gather data from public registries that they have legal access to use. To ensure that the data used for AI training is as accurate as possible, the controller only collects data from data sources with correct and up-to date information. Finally, the bank tests whether the AI is reliable and provides non-discriminatory results. When the AI is fully trained and operative, the bank uses the results as a part of the loan assessments, and will never rely solely on the AI to decide whether to grant loans. The bank will also review the reliability of the results from the AI at regular intervals. Example 2 The controller is a health institution looking to find methods to ensure the integrity and accuracy of personal data in their client registers. In situations where two persons arrive at the institution at the same time and receive the same treatment, there is a risk of mistaking them if the only parameter to separate them is by name. To ensure accuracy, the controller needs a unique identifier for each person, and therefore more information than just the name of the client. The institution uses several systems containing personal information of clients, and need to ensure that the information related to the client is correct, accurate and consistent in all the systems at any point in time. The institution has identified several risks that may arise if information is changed in one system but not another. The controller decides to mitigate the risk by using a hashing technique that can be used to ensure integrity of data in the treatment journal. Immutable hash signatures are created for treatment journal records and the employee associated with them so that any changes can be recognized, correlated and traced if required.

[38] [38] Art. 5(1)(d) GDPR 78. The requirements should be seen in relation to the risks and consequences of the concrete use of data. Inaccurate personal data could be a risk to the data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms, for example when leading to a faulty diagnosis or wrongful treatment of a health protocol, or an incorrect image of a person can lead to decisions being made on the wrong basis either manually, using automated decision-making, or through artificial intelligence. 79. Key design and default accuracy elements may include: \u2022 Data source \u2013 Sources of personal data should be reliable in terms of data accuracy. \u2022 Degree of accuracy \u2013 Each personal data element should be as accurate as necessary for the specified purposes. \u2022 Measurably accurate \u2013 Reduce the number of false positives/negatives, for example biases in automated decisions and artificial intelligence. \u2022 Verification \u2013 Depending on the nature of the data, in relation to how often it may change, the controller should verify the correctness of personal data with the data subject before and at different stages of the processing (e.g. to age requirements). \u2022 Erasure/rectification \u2013 The controller shall erase or rectify inaccurate data without delay. The controller shall in particular facilitate this where the data subjects are or were children and later want to remove such personal data.[39] [39] Cf. Recital 65. \u2022 Error propagation avoidance \u2013 Controllers should mitigate the effect of an accumulated error in the processing chain. \u2022 Access \u2013 Data subjects should be given information about and effective access to personal data in accordance with the GDPR articles 12 to 15 in order to control accuracy and rectify as needed. \u2022 Continued accuracy \u2013 Personal data should be accurate at all stages of the processing, tests of accuracy should be carried out at critical steps. \u2022 Up to date \u2013 Personal data shall be updated if necessary for the purpose. \u2022 Data design \u2013 Use of technological and organisational design features to decrease inaccuracy, for example present concise predetermined choices instead of free text fields.

The controller makes an internal procedure for data retention and deletion. According to this, employees must manually delete personal data after the retention period ends. The employee follows the procedure to regularly delete and correct data from any devices, from backups, logs, e-mails and other relevant storage media. To make deletion more effective, the controller instead implements an automatic system to delete data automatically and more regularly. The system is configured to follow the given procedure for data deletion which then occurs at a predefined regular interval to remove personal data from all of the company\u2019s storage media. The controller reviews and tests the retention policy regularly.

Expert commentary ISO 27701 Guidelines & Case Law Related Expert commentary Example of integrity and confidentiality measures A controller wants to extract personal data from a medical database to a server in the company. The company has assessed the risk for routing the extracts to a server that is accessible to all of the company\u2019s employees as likely to be high for data subjects\u2019 rights and freedoms. There is only one department in the company who needs to process these patient data. The extracts will also have a high value to the company. To regulate access and mitigate possible damage from malware, the company decides to segregate the network, and establish access controls to the server and the directory. In addition, they put up security monitoring and an intrusion detection and prevention system. The controller activates access control on the server and isolates it from routine use. An automated auditing system is put in place to monitor access and changes. Reporting and automated alerts are generated from this when certain events related to usage are configured. This security measure will ensure that all users have access on a need to know basis and with the appropriate access level. Inappropriate use can be quickly and easily recognised. Some of the extracts have to be compared with new extracts, and must therefore be stored for three months. The controller decides to put them into separate directories and encrypt the stored extracts. Handling the incident makes the system more robust, and reliable, both for the controller and the data subjects. The data controller understands that preventative and effective measures and safeguards should be built into all personal data processing undertakes now and in the future, and that doing so may help prevent future such data breach incidents. The controller establishes these security measures both to ensure accuracy, integrity and confidentiality, but also to prevent malware spread by cyber-attacks to make the solution robust.

Processing shall be lawful only if and to the extent that at least one of the following applies: (a) the data subject has given consent to the processing of his or her personal data for one or more specific purposes; Guidelines & Case Law Related Guidelines & Case Law WP29, Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 (2018). EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020).

EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020). Related Article 7 GDPR. Conditions for consent 1. Where processing is based on consent, the controller shall be able to demonstrate that the data subject has consented to processing of his or her personal data. 2. If the data subject\u2019s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. 3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. 4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 55. Article 6(1)(a) confirms that the consent of the data subject must be given in relation to \u201cone or more specific\u201d purposes and that a data subject has a choice in relation to each of them.[26] The requirement that consent must be \u2018specific\u2019 aims to ensure a degree of user control and transparency for the data subject. This requirement has not been changed by the GDPR and remains closely linked to the requirement of \u2018informed\u2019 consent. At the same time, it must be interpreted in line with the requirement for \u2018granularity\u2019 to obtain \u2018free\u2019 consent.[27] In sum, to comply with the element of \u2018specific\u2019 the controller must apply: i Purpose specification as a safeguard against function creep, ii Granularity in consent requests, and iii Clear separation of information related to obtaining consent for data processing activities from information about other matters. [26] Further guidance on the determination of \u2018purposes\u2019 can be found in Opinion 3/2013 on purpose limitation (WP 203). [27] Recital 43 GDPR states that separate consent for different processing operations will be needed wherever appropriate. Granular consent options should be provided to allow data subjects to consent separately to separate purposes. 60. Ad. (ii): Consent mechanisms must not only be granular to meet the requirement of \u2018free\u2019, but also to meet the element of \u2018specific\u2019. This means, a controller that seeks consent for various different purposes should provide a separate opt-in for each purpose, to allow users to give specific consent for specific purposes. (b) processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract; Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Related Guidelines & Case Law EDPB, Guidelines 2/2019 on the Processing of Personal Data under Article 6(1)(b) GDPR in the Context of the Provision of Online Services to Data Subjects (2019). EDPB, Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR (2020). Payment services are always provided on a contractual basis between the payment services user and the payment services provider. Controllers have to assess what processing of personal data is objectively necessary to perform the contract. Justification of the necessity is dependent on: the nature of the service; the mutual perspectives and expectations of the parties to the contract; the rationale of the contract; and the essential elements of the contract. The controller should be able to demonstrate how the main object of the specific contract with the data subject cannot be performed if the specific processing of the personal data in question does not occur. Merely referencing or mentioning data processing in a contract is not enough to bring the processing in question within the scope of Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. Recitals (44) Processing should be lawful where it is necessary in the context of a contract or the intention to enter into a contract. Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 30. According to Opinion 06/2014 of WP29, the term \u201cnecessary for the performance of a contract\u201d needs to be interpreted strictly. The processing must be necessary to fulfil the contract with each individual data subject. This may include, for example, processing the address of the data subject so that goods purchased online can be delivered, or processing credit card details in order to facilitate payment. In the employment context, this ground may allow, for example, the processing of salary information and bank account details so that wages can be paid.[22] There needs to be a direct and objective link between the processing of the data and the purpose of the execution of the contract. [22] The appropriate lawful basis could then be Article 6(1)(b) (contract). (c) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject; Recitals Recitals (45) Where processing is carried out in accordance with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority, the processing should have a basis in Union or Member State law. This Regulation does not require a specific law for each individual processing. A law as a basis for several processing operations based on a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or where processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of an official authority may be sufficient. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine the purpose of processing. Furthermore, that law could specify the general conditions of this Regulation governing the lawfulness of personal data processing, establish specifications for determining the controller, the type of personal data which are subject to the processing, the data subjects concerned, the entities to which the personal data may be disclosed, the purpose limitations, the storage period and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing. It should also be for Union or Member State law to determine whether the controller performing a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority should be a public authority or another natural or legal person governed by public law, or, where it is in the public interest to do so, including for health purposes such as public health and social protection and the management of health care services, by private law, such as a professional association. (d) processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person; Recitals Recitals (46) The processing of personal data should also be regarded to be lawful where it is necessary to protect an interest which is essential for the life of the data subject or that of another natural person. Processing of personal data based on the vital interest of another natural person should in principle take place only where the processing cannot be manifestly based on another legal basis. Some types of processing may serve both important grounds of public interest and the vital interests of the data subject as for instance when processing is necessary for humanitarian purposes, including for monitoring epidemics and their spread or in situations of humanitarian emergencies, in particular in situations of natural and man-made disasters. (e) processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller; Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Guidelines & Case Law EDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020). EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020). Recitals (115) Some third countries adopt laws, regulations and other legal acts which purport to directly regulate the processing activities of natural and legal persons under the jurisdiction of the Member States. This may include judgments of courts or tribunals or decisions of administrative authorities in third countries requiring a controller or processor to transfer or disclose personal data, and which are not based on an international agreement, such as a mutual legal assistance treaty, in force between the requesting third country and the Union or a Member State. The extraterritorial application of those laws, regulations and other legal acts may be in breach of international law and may impede the attainment of the protection of natural persons ensured in the Union by this Regulation. Transfers should only be allowed where the conditions of this Regulation for a transfer to third countries are met. This may be the case, inter alia, where disclosure is necessary for an important ground of public interest recognised in Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject. (f) processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular where the data subject is a child. Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Guidelines & Case Law Documents WP29, Opinion on the \u201cNotion of legitimate interests of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC\u201d (2014). EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020): 44. For what concerns the legitimate interest lawful basis, the EDPB recalls that in Fashion ID, the CJEU reiterated that in order for processing to rely on the legitimate interest, three cumulative conditions should be met, namely the pursuit of a legitimate interest by the data controller or by the third party or parties to whom the data are disclosed, the need to process personal data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued, and the condition that the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject whose data require protection do not take precedence. The CJEU also specified that in a situation of joint controllership \u201cit is necessary that each of those controllers should pursue a legitimate interest [\u2026] through those processing operations in order for those operations to be justified in respect of each of them\u201d. EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020). Data Protection Commission (Ireland), Data Protection Considerations Relating to Receivership (2020). EDPB, Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR (2020). The GDPR may allow for the processing of silent party data when this processing is necessary for purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by a controller or by a third party. A lawful basis for the processing of silent party data by PISPs and AISPs \u2013 in the context of the provision of payment services under the PSD2 \u2013 could thus be the legitimate interest of a controller or a third party to perform the contract with the payment service user. The necessity to process personal data of the silent party is limited and determined by the reasonable expectations of these data subjects. Effective and appropriate measures have to be established by all parties involved. In this respect, the controller has to establish the necessary safeguards for the processing, including technical measures. If feasible, also encryption or other techniques must be applied to achieve an appropriate level of security and data minimisation. Case Law CJEU, TK v Asocia\u0163ia de Proprietari bloc M5A-ScaraA, Case C-708/18 (2018). Recitals (47) The legitimate interests of a controller, including those of a controller to which the personal data may be disclosed, or of a third party, may provide a legal basis for processing, provided that the interests or the fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject are not overriding, taking into consideration the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller. Such legitimate interest could exist for example where there is a relevant and appropriate relationship between the data subject and the controller in situations such as where the data subject is a client or in the service of the controller. At any rate the existence of a legitimate interest would need careful assessment including whether a data subject can reasonably expect at the time and in the context of the collection of the personal data that processing for that purpose may take place. The interests and fundamental rights of the data subject could in particular override the interest of the data controller where personal data are processed in circumstances where data subjects do not reasonably expect further processing. Given that it is for the legislator to provide by law for the legal basis for public authorities to process personal data, that legal basis should not apply to the processing by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. The processing of personal data strictly necessary for the purposes of preventing fraud also constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. The processing of personal data for direct marketing purposes may be regarded as carried out for a legitimate interest. (48) Controllers that are part of a group of undertakings or institutions affiliated to a central body may have a legitimate interest in transmitting personal data within the group of undertakings for internal administrative purposes, including the processing of clients' or employees' personal data. The general principles for the transfer of personal data, within a group of undertakings, to an undertaking located in a third country remain unaffected. (49) The processing of personal data to the extent strictly necessary and proportionate for the purposes of ensuring network and information security, i.e. the ability of a network or an information system to resist, at a given level of confidence, accidental events or unlawful or malicious actions that compromise the availability, authenticity, integrity and confidentiality of stored or transmitted personal data, and the security of the related services offered by, or accessible via, those networks and systems, by public authorities, by computer emergency response teams (CERTs), computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs), by providers of electronic communications networks and services and by providers of security technologies and services, constitutes a legitimate interest of the data controller concerned. This could, for example, include preventing unauthorised access to electronic communications networks and malicious code distribution and stopping \u2018denial of service\u2019 attacks and damage to computer and electronic communication systems. Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks. Recitals Recitals (40) In order for processing to be lawful, personal data should be processed on the basis of the consent of the data subject concerned or some other legitimate basis, laid down by law, either in this Regulation or in other Union or Member State law as referred to in this Regulation, including the necessity for compliance with the legal obligation to which the controller is subject or the necessity for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. (50) The processing of personal data for purposes other than those for which the personal data were initially collected should be allowed only where the processing is compatible with the purposes for which the personal data were initially collected. In such a case, no legal basis separate from that which allowed the collection of the personal data is required. If the processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller, Union or Member State law may determine and specify the tasks and purposes for which the further processing should be regarded as compatible and lawful. Further processing for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes should be considered to be compatible lawful processing operations. The legal basis provided by Union or Member State law for the processing of personal data may also provide a legal basis for further processing. In order to ascertain whether a purpose of further processing is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, the controller, after having met all the requirements for the lawfulness of the original processing, should take into account, inter alia: any link between those purposes and the purposes of the intended further processing; the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular the reasonable expectations of data subjects based on their relationship with the controller as to their further use; the nature of the personal data; the consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; and the existence of appropriate safeguards in both the original and intended further processing operations. Where the data subject has given consent or the processing is based on Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard, in particular, important objectives of general public interest, the controller should be allowed to further process the personal data irrespective of the compatibility of the purposes. In any case, the application of the principles set out in this Regulation and in particular the information of the data subject on those other purposes and on his or her rights including the right to object, should be ensured. Indicating possible criminal acts or threats to public security by the controller and transmitting the relevant personal data in individual cases or in several cases relating to the same criminal act or threats to public security to a competent authority should be regarded as being in the legitimate interest pursued by the controller. However, such transmission in the legitimate interest of the controller or further processing of personal data should be prohibited if the processing is not compatible with a legal, professional or other binding obligation of secrecy. 2. Member States may maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation with regard to processing for compliance with points (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 by determining more precisely specific requirements for the processing and other measures to ensure lawful and fair processing including for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. 3. The basis for the processing referred to in point (c) and (e) of paragraph 1 shall be laid down by: (a) Union law; or (b) Member State law to which the controller is subject. The purpose of the processing shall be determined in that legal basis or, as regards the processing referred to in point (e) of paragraph 1, shall be necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. That legal basis may contain specific provisions to adapt the application of rules of this Regulation, inter alia: the general conditions governing the lawfulness of processing by the controller; the types of data which are subject to the processing; the data subjects concerned; the entities to, and the purposes for which, the personal data may be disclosed; the purpose limitation; storage periods; and processing operations and processing procedures, including measures to ensure lawful and fair processing such as those for other specific processing situations as provided for in Chapter IX. The Union or the Member State law shall meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued. Recitals Recitals (41) Where this Regulation refers to a legal basis or a legislative measure, this does not necessarily require a legislative act adopted by a parliament, without prejudice to requirements pursuant to the constitutional order of the Member State concerned. However, such a legal basis or legislative measure should be clear and precise and its application should be foreseeable to persons subject to it, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \u2018Court of Justice\u2019) and the European Court of Human Rights. 4. Where the processing for a purpose other than that for which the personal data have been collected is not based on the data subject\u2019s consent or on a Union or Member State law which constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard the objectives referred to in Article 23(1), the controller shall, in order to ascertain whether processing for another purpose is compatible with the purpose for which the personal data are initially collected, take into account, inter alia: Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Documents EDPB, Guidelines 3/2019 on Processing of Personal Data through Video Devices (2020). (a) any link between the purposes for which the personal data have been collected and the purposes of the intended further processing; (b) the context in which the personal data have been collected, in particular regarding the relationship between data subjects and the controller; (c) the nature of the personal data, in particular whether special categories of personal data are processed, pursuant to Article 9, or whether personal data related to criminal convictions and offences are processed, pursuant to Article 10; (d) the possible consequences of the intended further processing for data subjects; (e) the existence of appropriate safeguards, which may include encryption or pseudonymisation.

Related Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Demonstrate consent 107. It is up to the controller to prove that valid consent was obtained from the data subject. The GDPR does not prescribe exactly how this must be done. However, the controller must be able to prove that a data subject in a given case has consented. As long as a data processing activity in question lasts, the obligation to demonstrate consent exists. After the processing activity ends, proof of consent should be kept no longer then strictly necessary for compliance with a legal obligation or for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, in accordance with Article 17(3)(b) and (e). 2. If the data subject\u2019s consent is given in the context of a written declaration which also concerns other matters, the request for consent shall be presented in a manner which is clearly distinguishable from the other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language. Any part of such a declaration which constitutes an infringement of this Regulation shall not be binding. Recitals Related Recitals (42) Where processing is based on the data subject's consent, the controller should be able to demonstrate that the data subject has given consent to the processing operation. In particular in the context of a written declaration on another matter, safeguards should ensure that the data subject is aware of the fact that and the extent to which consent is given. In accordance with Council Directive 93/13/EEC [10] a declaration of consent pre-formulated by the controller should be provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language and it should not contain unfair terms. For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended. Consent should not be regarded as freely given if the data subject has no genuine or free choice or is unable to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment. [10] Council Directive 93/13/EEC of 5 April 1993 on unfair terms in consumer contracts (OJ L 95, 21.4.1993, p. 29). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1993:095:TOC Related Article 29 Working Party Guidelines on transparency under Regulation 2016/679 The \u201ceasily accessible\u201d element means that the data subject should not have to seek out the information; it should be immediately apparent to them where and how this information can be accessed, for example by providing it directly to them, by linking them to it, by clearly signposting it or as an answer to a natural language question (for example in an online layered privacy statement/ notice, in FAQs, by way of contextual pop-ups which activate when a data subject fills in an online form, or in an interactive digital context through a chatbot interface, etc. These mechanisms are further considered below, including at paragraphs 33 to 40). \u201cClear and plain language\u201d With written information (and where written information is delivered orally, or by audio/ audiovisual methods, including for vision-impaired data subjects), best practices for clear writing should be followed.11 A similar language requirement (for \u201cplain, intelligible language\u201d) has previously been used by the EU legislator12 and is also explicitly referred to in the context of consent in Recital 42 of the GDPR13. The requirement for clear and plain language means that information should be provided in as simple a manner as possible, avoiding complex sentence and language structures. The information should be concrete and definitive; it should not be phrased in abstract or ambivalent terms or leave room for different interpretations. In particular the purposes of, and legal basis for, processing the personal data should be clear. Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 How to provide information 66. The GDPR does not prescribe the form or shape in which information must be provided in order to fulfil the requirement of informed consent. This means valid information may be presented in various ways, such as written or oral statements, or audio or video messages. However, the GDPR puts several requirements for informed consent in place, predominantly in Article 7(2) and Recital 32. This leads to a higher standard for the clarity and accessibility of the information. 67. When seeking consent, controllers should ensure that they use clear and plain language in all cases. This means a message should be easily understandable for the average person and not only for lawyers. Controllers cannot use long privacy policies that are difficult to understand or statements full of legal jargon. Consent must be clear and distinguishable from other matters and provided in an intelligible and easily accessible form. This requirement essentially means that information relevant for making informed decisions on whether or not to consent may not be hidden in general terms and conditions.[36] [36] The declaration of consent must be named as such. Drafting, such as \u201cI know that\u2026\u201d does not meet the requirement of clear language. 3. The data subject shall have the right to withdraw his or her consent at any time. The withdrawal of consent shall not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal. Prior to giving consent, the data subject shall be informed thereof. It shall be as easy to withdraw as to give consent. ISO 27701 Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 7(3) GDPR: 7.3.4 Providing mechanism to modify or withdraw consent Control The organization should provide a mechanism for PII principals to modify or withdraw their consent.

The controller must identify a valid legal basis for the processing of personal data. Measures and safeguards should support the requirement to make sure that the whole processing lifecycle is in line with the relevant legal grounds of processing. Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Withdrawal of consent 113. Article 7(3) of the GDPR prescribes that the controller must ensure that consent can be withdrawn by the data subject as easy as giving consent and at any given time. The GDPR does not say that giving and withdrawing consent must always be done through the same action. 114. However, when consent is obtained via electronic means through only one mouse-click, swipe, or keystroke, data subjects must, in practice, be able to withdraw that consent equally as easily. Where consent is obtained through use of a service-specific user interface (for example, via a website, an app, a log-on account, the interface of an IoT device or by e-mail), there is no doubt a data subject must be able to withdraw consent via the same electronic interface, as switching to another interface for the sole reason of withdrawing consent would require undue effort. Furthermore, the data subject should be able to withdraw his/her consent without detriment. This means, inter alia, that a controller must make withdrawal of consent possible free of charge or without lowering service levels.[51] [51] See also opinion WP29 Opinion 4/2010 on the European code of conduct of FEDMA for the use of personal data in direct marketing (WP 174) and the Opinion on the use of location data with a view to providing value-added services (WP 115). 4. When assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract. ISO 27701 Recitals Related ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII processors. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 7(4) GDPR: 8.2.3 Marketing and advertising use Control The organization should not use PII processed under a contract for the purposes of marketing and advertising without establishing that prior consent was obtained from the appropriate PII principal. [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Recitals (43) In order to ensure that consent is freely given, consent should not provide a valid legal ground for the processing of personal data in a specific case where there is a clear imbalance between the data subject and the controller, in particular where the controller is a public authority and it is therefore unlikely that consent was freely given in all the circumstances of that specific situation. Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent despite such consent not being necessary for such performance. (32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided. Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Conditionality 25. To assess whether consent is freely given, Article 7(4) GDPR plays an important role.[21] [21] Article 7(4) GDPR: \u201cWhen assessing whether consent is freely given, utmost account shall be taken of whether, inter alia, the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is conditional on consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for the performance of that contract.\u201d See also Recital 43 GDPR, that states: \u201c[\u2026] Consent is presumed not to be freely given if it does not allow separate consent to be given to different personal data processing operations despite it being appropriate in the individual case, or if the performance of a contract, including the provision of a service, is dependent on the consent, despite such consent not being necessary for such performance.\u201d For more information and examples, see Opinion 06/2014 on the notion of legitimate interest of the data controller under Article 7 of Directive 95/46/EC, adopted by WP29 on 9 April 2014, p. 16-17. (WP 217). 26. Article 7(4) GDPR indicates that, inter alia, the situation of \u201cbundling\u201d consent with acceptance of terms or conditions, or \u201ctying\u201d the provision of a contract or a service to a request for consent to process personal data that are not necessary for the performance of that contract or service, is considered highly undesirable. If consent is given in this situation, it is presumed to be not freely given (recital 43). Article 7(4) seeks to ensure that the purpose of personal data processing is not disguised nor bundled with the provision of a contract of a service for which these personal data are not necessary. In doing so, the GDPR ensures that the processing of personal data for which consent is sought cannot become directly or indirectly the counter-performance of a contract. The two lawful bases for the lawful processing of personal data, i.e. consent and contract cannot be merged and blurred.",

Where a data controller is targeting children[16] or is, or should be, aware that their goods/services are particularly utilised by children (including where the controller is relying on the consent of the child)[17], it should ensure that the vocabulary, tone and style of the language used is appropriate to and resonates with children so that the child addressee of the information recognises that the message/ information is being directed at them.[18] A useful example of child-centred language used as an alternative to the original legal language can be found in the \u201cUN Convention on the Rights of the Child in Child Friendly Language\u201d.[19] Related Article 6 GDPR.

While assessing the scope of this definition, the EDPB also refers to case law of the ECJ.[62] The ECJ held that information society services cover contracts and other services that are concluded or transmitted on-line. Where a service has two economically independent components, one being the online component, such as the offer and the acceptance of an offer in the context of the conclusion of a contract or the information relating to products or services, including marketing activities, this component is defined as an information society service, the other component being the physical delivery or distribution of goods is not covered by the notion of an information society service. The online delivery of a service would fall within the scope of the term information society service in Article 8 GDPR. [62] See European Court of Justice, 2 December 2010 Case C-108/09, (Ker-Optika), paragraphs 22 and 28. In relation to \u2018composite services\u2019, the EDPB also refers to Case C-434/15 (Asociacion Profesional Elite Taxi v Uber Systems Spain SL), para 40, which states that an information society service forming an integral part of an overall service whose main component is not an information society service (in this case a transport service), must not be qualified as \u2018an information society service\u2019.

Member States may provide by law for a lower age for those purposes provided that such lower age is not below 13 years. 2. The controller shall make reasonable efforts to verify in such cases that consent is given or authorised by the holder of parental responsibility over the child, taking into consideration available technology. Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Expert commentary Example. An online gaming platform wants to make sure underage customers only subscribe to its services with the consent of their parents or guardians. The controller follows these steps: Step 1: ask the user to state whether they are under or over the age of 16 (or alternative age of digital consent)If the user states that they are under the age of digital consent: Step 2: service informs the child that a parent or guardian needs to consent or authorise the processing before the service is provided to the child. The user is requested to disclose the email address of a parent or guardian. Step 3: service contacts the parent or guardian and obtains their consent via email for processing and take reasonable steps to confirm that the adult has parental responsibility. Step 4: in case of complaints, the platform takes additional steps to verify the age of the subscriber. If the platform has met the other consent requirements, the platform can comply with the additional criteria of Article 8 GDPR by following these steps.

In low-risk cases, verification of parental responsibility via email may be sufficient. Conversely, in high-risk cases, it may be appropriate to ask for more proof, so that the controller is able to verify and retain the information pursuant to Article 7(1) GDPR.

EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020): If a social media provider or a targeter uses observed data to categorise users as having certain religious, philosophical or political beliefs-regardless of whether the categorization is correct/true or not-this categorisation of the user must obviously be seen as processing of special category of personal data in this context. As long as the categorisation enables targeting based on special category data, it does not matter how the category is labelled. EDPB, Guidelines 06/2020 on the interplay of the Second Payment Services Directive and the GDPR (2020). Financial transactions can reveal sensitive information about individual data subject, including those related to special categories of personal data. For example, political opinions and religious beliefs may be revealed by donations made to political parties or organisations, churches or parishes. Trade union membership may be revealed by the deduction of an annual membership fee from a person\u2019s bank account. Personal data concerning health may be gathered from analysing medical bills paid by a data subject. Finally, information on certain purchases may reveal information concerning a person\u2019s sex life or sexual orientation. Moreover, through the sum of financial transactions, different kinds of behavioural patterns could be revealed, including special categories of personal data and additional services that are facilitated by account information services might rely on profiling as defined by article 4 (4) of the GDPR. Therefore, the chances are considerable that a service provider processing information on financial transactions of data subjects also processes special categories of personal data. Recitals (51) Personal data which are, by their nature, particularly sensitive in relation to fundamental rights and freedoms merit specific protection as the context of their processing could create significant risks to the fundamental rights and freedoms. Those personal data should include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, whereby the use of the term \u2018racial origin\u2019 in this Regulation does not imply an acceptance by the Union of theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races. The processing of photographs should not systematically be considered to be processing of special categories of personal data as they are covered by the definition of biometric data only when processed through a specific technical means allowing the unique identification or authentication of a natural person. Such personal data should not be processed, unless processing is allowed in specific cases set out in this Regulation, taking into account that Member States law may lay down specific provisions on data protection in order to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation for compliance with a legal obligation or for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller. In addition to the specific requirements for such processing, the general principles and other rules of this Regulation should apply, in particular as regards the conditions for lawful processing. Derogations from the general prohibition for processing such special categories of personal data should be explicitly provided, inter alia, where the data subject gives his or her explicit consent or in respect of specific needs in particular where the processing is carried out in the course of legitimate activities by certain associations or foundations the purpose of which is to permit the exercise of fundamental freedoms. 2. Paragraph 1 shall not apply if one of the following applies: Recitals Recitals (52) Derogating from the prohibition on processing special categories of personal data should also be allowed when provided for in Union or Member State law and subject to suitable safeguards, so as to protect personal data and other fundamental rights, where it is in the public interest to do so, in particular processing personal data in the field of employment law, social protection law including pensions and for health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health. Such a derogation may be made for health purposes, including public health and the management of health-care services, especially in order to ensure the quality and cost-effectiveness of the procedures used for settling claims for benefits and services in the health insurance system, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes. A derogation should also allow the processing of such personal data where necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims, whether in court proceedings or in an administrative or out-of-court procedure. (53) Special categories of personal data which merit higher protection should be processed for health-related purposes only where necessary to achieve those purposes for the benefit of natural persons and society as a whole, in particular in the context of the management of health or social care services and systems, including processing by the management and central national health authorities of such data for the purpose of quality control, management information and the general national and local supervision of the health or social care system, and ensuring continuity of health or social care and cross-border healthcare or health security, monitoring and alert purposes, or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research purposes or statistical purposes, based on Union or Member State law which has to meet an objective of public interest, as well as for studies conducted in the public interest in the area of public health. Therefore, this Regulation should provide for harmonised conditions for the processing of special categories of personal data concerning health, in respect of specific needs, in particular where the processing of such data is carried out for certain health-related purposes by persons subject to a legal obligation of professional secrecy. Union or Member State law should provide for specific and suitable measures so as to protect the fundamental rights and the personal data of natural persons. Member States should be allowed to maintain or introduce further conditions, including limitations, with regard to the processing of genetic data, biometric data or data concerning health. However, this should not hamper the free flow of personal data within the Union when those conditions apply to cross-border processing of such data. (54) The processing of special categories of personal data may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the areas of public health without consent of the data subject. Such processing should be subject to suitable and specific measures so as to protect the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In that context, \u2018public health\u2019 should be interpreted as defined in Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council [11], namely all elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality. Such processing of data concerning health for reasons of public interest should not result in personal data being processed for other purposes by third parties such as employers or insurance and banking companies. [11] Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on Community statistics on public health and health and safety at work (OJ L 354, 31.12.2008, p. 70). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2008:354:TOC (55) Moreover, the processing of personal data by official authorities for the purpose of achieving the aims, laid down by constitutional law or by international public law, of officially recognised religious associations, is carried out on grounds of public interest. (56) Where in the course of electoral activities, the operation of the democratic system in a Member State requires that political parties compile personal data on people's political opinions, the processing of such data may be permitted for reasons of public interest, provided that appropriate safeguards are established. (a) the data subject has given explicit consent to the processing of those personal data for one or more specified purposes, except where Union or Member State law provide that the prohibition referred to in paragraph 1 may not be lifted by the data subject; Expert commentary ISO 27701 Related Expert commentary The first exception is based on \u201cexplicit consent\u201d. Article 9 consent differs from the general notion of consent of article 6 in one important aspect: it must be explicitly provided by the person concerned. It means that the consent must be freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, under the definition of article 4 (11), and, in addition to these requirements, it must be \u201cexplicit\u201d. What form of consent is considered \u201cexplicit\u201d and thus valid under article 9? The sensitive nature of the data involved entails a consent that goes beyond the regular \u201cstatement or clear affirmative action\u201d [article 4 (11)] on the part of the data subject. It means that s/he must give \u201can express statement of consent\u201d (Guidelines on Consent), even in the case where services are provided on a contractual basis. An explicit consent is needed because there is no contract based exceptions in article 9 (2) a controller can rely on. The Guidelines on Consent suggest that a written statement or even a signed written statement may be required, even though the GDPR does not prescribe such a form of consent. A signed consent may be relevant if health data are collected, for example, in the context of services offered by a private clinic or a convalescent home. A plastic surgeon may need to gather information about a client\u2019s health condition or share medical information to seek a second opinion from one of her/his colleagues. The managers of a convalescent home will have to gather information about a future pensionary\u2019s health condition to arrange the appropriate services needed during her/his stay. A signed written statement is not as practical in the digital or online environment. How can a person consent if, for example, s/he buys a plane ticket online and requires special medical assistance at boarding time, during the flight or at her/his arrival at destination? A valid consent will also be difficult to obtain if a person places an online order for buying special eyewear as the seller has to collect health-related information about her/his vision and share it with the manufacturer. Simply following a link or ticking a box might be regarded as an insufficient consent in these examples. The Guidelines on Consent recommend other forms of consent, like filling in an electronic form, using an electronic signature, recording an oral statement or proceeding with a two-step verification (ticking a box in a form and confirming the consent by email afterward, for example). Article 9 prescribes that a person must consent \u201cfor one or more specified purposes\u201d. The requirement goes beyond the \u201cspecific\u201d quality of consent required by article 4 (11). Purposes must be clearly specified, which implies that the consent must be tied to specific data or precise categories of data that the controller will be allowed to process. You must always remember that the GDPR is not a complete statement on the state of the law on data protection in a particular Member State, and it is particularly true here because there is an exception to the exception. Consent is an invalid basis to process special categories of personal data if a Member State prohibits the lifting of the prohibition for processing special categories of personal data by an individual in its national legislation, as the GDPR allows it. Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question ISO 27701 ISO/IEC 27701, adopted in 2019, added additional ISO/IEC 27002 guidance for PII controllers. Here is the relevant paragraph to article 9(2)(a) GDPR: 7.2.4 Obtain and record consent Control The organization should obtain and record consent from PII principals according to the documented processes. Implementation guidance The organization should obtain and record consent from PII principals in such a way that it can provide on request details of the consent provided (for example the time that consent was provided, the identification of the PII principal, and the consent statement). [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 OBTAINING EXPLICIT CONSENT 93. The term explicit refers to the way consent is expressed by the data subject. It means that the data subject must give an express statement of consent. An obvious way to make sure consent is explicit would be to expressly confirm consent in a written statement. Where appropriate, the controller could make sure the written statement is signed by the data subject, in order to remove all possible doubt and potential lack of evidence in the future.[47] [47] See also WP29 Opinion 15/2011, on the definition of consent (WP 187), p. 25. 94. However, such a signed statement is not the only way to obtain explicit consent and, it cannot be said that the GDPR prescribes written and signed statements in all circumstances that require valid explicit consent. For example, in the digital or online context, a data subject may be able to issue the required statement by filling in an electronic form, by sending an email, by uploading a scanned document carrying the signature of the data subject, or by using an electronic signature. In theory, the use of oral statements can also be sufficiently express to obtain valid explicit consent, however, it may be difficult to prove for the controller that all conditions for valid explicit consent were met when the statement was recorded. 95. An organisation may also obtain explicit consent through a telephone conversation, provided that the information about the choice is fair, intelligible and clear, and it asks for a specific confirmation from the data subject (e.g. pressing a button or providing oral confirmation). (b) processing is necessary for the purposes of carrying out the obligations and exercising specific rights of the controller or of the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law in so far as it is authorised by Union or Member State law or a collective agreement pursuant to Member State law providing for appropriate safeguards for the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject; Expert commentary Expert commentary Processing of special categories of personal data in the field of employment, social security, and social protection law is possible only if it is \u201cnecessary\u201d (read about the necessity and proportionality principles in the general commentary below) and it satisfies two other conditions: it is authorised by the European Union or Member State law or a collective agreement; and there are appropriate safeguards in place to protect the fundamental rights and interests of individuals. The European regulation essentially refers to the legislation of the Member States to acknowledge the existence of exceptions and verify if individuals\u2019 fundamental rights are preserved. Therefore, there are no general rules applicable to the entire Union and the exception can only be understood on a State by State basis. The controller has to invoke a specific legal provision authorizing the processing of personal data in the context of employment, social security or social protection law. Member States may allow employers to collect personal data in order to provide health insurance policies to their employees, maintain records of sick, maternity or paternity leaves, deduct union dues from payslips or provide special working conditions or environment to persons with disabilities. They can also authorize insurers, for example, to process health data for paying accidents or invalidity indemnities to employees. Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question (c) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent; Expert commentary Expert commentary According to article 9 2) (c), processing of special categories of personal data is allowed if it is \u201cnecessary\u201d (read about the necessity and proportionality principles in the general commentary below) to protect a person\u2019s vital interests or third parties\u2019 ones. The vital interests exception is similar to article 6 1) (d) lawful basis to process data except that it applies only if you cannot obtain a person\u2019s consent. The scope of the exception is limited as it concerns only the protection of a \u201cvital interest\u201d of a person, that is to say, \u201can interest which is essential for [her/his] life\u201d (recital 46). It includes threats to the physical integrity or life of a person or a third person. In other words, it must be a matter of life and death even though recital 46 seems to widen the scope of the exception. It suggests that it may also apply to humanitarian situations such as monitoring epidemics or providing relief for natural or man-made disasters. The second condition limits drastically the scope of the vital interests exception: it may be invoked only if the individual is physically or legally incapable of giving consent. It can be the case if a person is unconscious, for example, or is unable to consent because of her/his legal status, like a minor or an adult under guardianship or trusteeship. You should ask for explicit consent, according to paragraph 2 a) of article 9, whenever it is possible. You cannot rely on the vital interests exception as an alternative option if a person is able to consent and has refused to do so. Essentially, the vital interests exception is useful for medical emergency situations. If a person has suffered a life-threatening injury, for example, the medical staff may need her/his medical history to decide on the proper treatment. As the person is unable to offer her/his consent, the hospital needs a legal basis to process her/his health data and the vital interests exception might prove useful. It can also be convenient in cases of epidemics. It may be impossible for all infected individuals to consent in a timely manner to allow medical staff to gather data in order to prevent the spread of the epidemic and, in doing so, to protect third parties\u2019 vital interests. Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question (d) processing is carried out in the course of its legitimate activities with appropriate safeguards by a foundation, association or any other not-for-profit body with a political, philosophical, religious or trade union aim and on condition that the processing relates solely to the members or to former members of the body or to persons who have regular contact with it in connection with its purposes and that the personal data are not disclosed outside that body without the consent of the data subjects; Expert commentary Expert commentary The General Data Protection Regulation contains a circumscribed exception for the processing of special categories of personal data by the following types of organizations: associations; foundations; and other not-for-profit bodies. The list appears to be closed and limited to these exact types of organizations, excluding any other types. As the legal status of charity, nonprofit, and philanthropy organizations is not uniform in the European Union, one should not attach too much importance to the name of the concerned body. The word \u201cother\u201d confirms that the list is illustrative and the exact nature of the organization depends on the legal form and structure the Member States give them. It is more a question of the aims or goals of the organization than of its exact denomination, as it must pursue one of the following objectives political; philosophical; religious; or trade union. The list refers to a limited number of activities and it cannot be extended beyond. Political parties, worship organizations or trade unions are clearly targeted. The philosophical aim category is not as easy to define. An organization devoted to environmental, vegan or anti-speciesism questions may qualify as pursuing a philosophical goal depending on a Member State law. How far that category may be expanded will depend on the Court of Justice of the European Union interpretation of the provision. These organizations must process special categories of personal data only in the course of their \u201clegitimate activities\u201d. It means that the processing must be directly connected to the political, philosophical, religious or trade union activities of the organization. An association, a foundation or any other not-for-profit body cannot invoke that exception to process special categories of personal data that are not closely related to its core activities in accordance with its purposes and powers set out in its governing charter. The GDPR requires that organizations handle special categories of personal data with appropriate safeguards. It is not clear what exactly the legislator had in mind by adopting this additional condition. It clearly implies that proper security measures should be in place to protect the processed data due to their sensitive nature. Data must also be accessible only to the persons who need to deal with them to achieve the organizations\u2019 aims. It follows logically that the personal data cannot be disclosed outside the organization, although article 9 2) (d) allows such divulgation with the consent of the concerned individuals. The body cannot share its membership list, for example, with other organizations unless it obtained its members\u2019 consent. I do not see any legal impediment prohibiting the selling of that same list to finance the organization\u2019s activities if its members consent to the divulgation of their personal data. The organization will also have to seek consent to name any individual members in a fundraiser campaign or an annual report, for example. The scope of the exception is limited to processing special categories of personal data concerning an organization\u2019s i) members, ii) former members or iii) individuals who have \u201cregular contact\u201d with it in connection with its goals. It excludes the organization\u2019s employees or prospective members before they join the organization, but it may include partners, contributors or regular beneficiaries of the organization\u2019s services who are not formally members of it. It is a self-evident exception to the general rule that special categories of personal data cannot be processed as it allows organizations that owe their existence solely to the pursuit of one of the goals mentioned to process data essential to their operation. How would a political party exist if it cannot process the political opinions of their partisans? It is the same with trade unions that have to deal with data concerning their members or churches that have to process data revealing their believers\u2019 religious beliefs in the course of their regular activities (see article 91). Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question (e) processing relates to personal data which are manifestly made public by the data subject; Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Expert commentary The European legislator introduced an exception \u2013 for special categories of personal data which are manifestly made public by a person \u2013 that seems completely logical at first glance. If a person willingly shares her/his data, it sounds reasonable to allow the processing of these data by third parties. On second thought, many questions come to mind. What does \u201cmanifestly\u201d mean? When are data \u201cpublic\u201d? How to determine if a person intended to make her/his data public? The exception does not concern all special categories of data publicly available. It applies strictly to data that an individual personally disclosed. It must be a publication that results from a clear and voluntary decision from an individual to disclose information about her/him. It should not be an accidental, inadvertent, involuntary or unintentional disclosure. It should be the result of a free and deliberate decision. The individual must be fully conscious that s/he made her/his data public. Thus, it excludes leaked data, data accessible after a security breach or data shared unintentionally or by inadvertence\u2026 [\u2026] Sign in to read the full text Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question Guidelines & Case Law EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020): The word \u201cmanifestly\u201d implies that there must be a high threshold for relying on this exemption.The EDPB notes that the presence of a single element may not always be sufficient to establish that the data have been \u201cmanifestly\u201d made public by the data subject. In practice,a combination of the following or other elements may need to be considered for controllers to demonstrate that the data subject has clearly manifested the intention to make the data public, and a case-by-case assessment is needed. The following elements may be relevant to help inform this assessment: the default settings of the social media platform (i.e. whether the data subject took a specific action to change these default private settings into public ones); or the nature of the social media platform (i.e. whether this platform is intrinsically linked with the idea of connecting with close acquaintances of the data subject or creating intimate relations (such as online dating platforms), or if it is meant to provide a wider scope of interpersonal relations, such as professional relations, or microblogging, etc\u2026 ; or the accessibility of the page where the sensitive data is published (i.e. whether the information is publically accessible or if, for instance, the creation of an account is necessary before accessing the information); or the visibility of the information where the data subject is informed of the public nature of the information that they publish (i.e. whether there is for example a continuous banner on the page, or whether the button for publishing informs the data subject that the information will be made public\u2026); or if the data subject has published the sensitive data himself/herself, or whether instead the data has been published by a third party (e.g. a photo published by a friend which reveals sensitive data) or inferred. The EDPB notes that the presence of a single element may not always be sufficient to establish that the data have been \u201cmanifestly\u201d made public by the data subject. In practice,a combination of these or other elements may need to be considered for controllers to demonstrate that the data subject has clearly manifested the intention to make the data public. (f) processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims or whenever courts are acting in their judicial capacity; Expert commentary Expert commentary The legal exception comprises two distinct parts, as it applies to: processing necessary for establishing, exercising or defending a legal claim, and courts acting in their judicial capacity. 1) The legal claim exception, in the context of article 9, is broad and is not limited to pending legal proceedings. It applies to ongoing legal claims along with prospective ones. A person may have to share personal data in order to obtain legal advice, to report a situation that may potentially lead to a legal claim or to prepare future proceedings, even if no procedures have been filed in court yet. It might concern administrative or court proceedings, as well as out-of-court procedures (recital 52). The keyword in paragraph 2) (f) is \u201cnecessary\u201d (read about the necessity principle in the general commentary below): the use of personal information must be necessary to establish, exercise or defend legal rights. It still needs to be defined what necessary means in the context of the GDPR. A reference to the general necessity principle in European Union law should lead to justifying the use of personal data for the legal claim exception based on objective evidence. There must be a substantial connection between the processing and the data processed in the context of a specific case. The use of personal data should also be proportionate (read about the proportionality principle in the general commentary below): it should not go beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective pursued. Data used must be adequate and relevant \u201cfor the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims\u201d and their use should be limited to what is needed. In other words, it means that you should not use more data than what is necessary to proceed. An example of using personal data before any legal proceedings have been initiated is if you have to report an accident to your insurer. Your insurer will eventually have to deal with data concerning your health or the health of other persons implicated in the accident. It does not mean that a claim will be brought before the court and if so, that it will not be settled before any proceedings take place. I may cite another typical example, concerning this time the establishment of a defence to an actual legal claim. Your employee is suing you after that an accident has occurred in the workplace. You will have to share the details of the accident, including information in your possession about the injuries your employee has suffered, with your lawyer. As these data are considered health-related information, you will have to invoke paragraph 2) (f) exception. 2) The second part of the legal exception concerns courts acting in their judicial capacity. The exception is necessary to preserve the independence of justice (recital 20), which also ensures compliance with legal guarantees provided for by European and national rights and freedoms instruments. The GDPR does not specify the scope of the expression \u201ccourts [\u2026] acting in their judicial capacity\u201d, except that it includes the decision-making process (recital 20). Article 9 mentions only \u201ccourts\u201d, but recital 97 seems to extend the exception to \u201cindependent judicial authorities\u201d. Even if it is not the case, the interpretation of the term \u201ccourt\u201d may lead to such an extension. It raises questions in consequence for many existing procedures lead by quasi-judicial bodies, like arbitrators, arbitration tribunals or public administrative agencies. They conduct proceedings, during which the rights and freedoms of the parties involved must be guaranteed, they determine facts, they interpret the law, and they have powers of adjudication much like any courts of law. Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question (g) processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest, on the basis of Union or Member State law which shall be proportionate to the aim pursued, respect the essence of the right to data protection and provide for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of the data subject; Expert commentary Expert commentary The substantial public interest exception is characterized by the number of conditions attached to it and therefore its limited scope: Processing must be necessary; It must be based on a Union or Member State law; and The Union or Member State law itself must: be proportionate to the goal pursued; respect the essence of the right to data protection; and guarantee suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of individuals concerned. The terms \u201csubstantial public interest\u201d are not defined in the General Data Protection Regulation. As the exception refers to the Union or Member State law, article 9 2) (g) gives a margin of appreciation to the national jurisdictions to decide locally what is of \u201csubstantial public interest\u201d. A \u201csubstantial\u201d public interest clearly requires a higher standard than simple public interest. If the latter refers to the public good and what is in the best interests of the society, the former must have to do with a real and tangible interest, an interest of considerable importance. A substantial public interest may be related to the exercise of fundamental rights and freedoms, like organizing the electoral process, or the maintenance of order and security, like fighting terrorism. The Data Protection Act 2018, for example, recognizes twenty-three (23) cases where a substantial public interest is involved in the United Kingdom. Exceptions range from the administration of justice to safeguarding of children at risk, and extend to equality of opportunity, anti-doping in sport or publication of legal decisions. It is hard to distinguish in these examples what is in the general public interest and what is based on \u201csubstantial\u201d public interest. The substantial public interest exception does not apply to special categories of personal data which already benefit from an exception under article 9, like public health [paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (i)]. It is sometimes tricky though to decide which exception is applicable. One must refer to the specifics of the case and examine the facts attentively to decide what would be the best legal basis to process special categories of personal data. Political parties may be required by a Member State\u2019s legislation to compile personal data on individuals\u2019 political opinions in the course of the electoral process based on the substantial public interest exception (recital 56). It differs from the foundation, association or not-for-profit body exception [article 9 2) (d)] in one aspect: the compilation is required by law and is not done as part of a political party\u2019s main activities. It also exempts the organization from obtaining its members\u2019 consent to divulge the collected personal data to the appropriate authorities. I was asked recently about the proper legal basis to process data about students with disabilities. A school needs to collect and use these data to offer children services adapted to their learning capacity. Information about disabilities should be considered health-related data and thus special categories of personal data. They cannot be processed unless there is a specific exception that can be invoked. It does not seem to be possible to rely on the public health exception [see paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (i) comment] to satisfy that request. If the Member State\u2019s legislation in which the school operates provides for an exception to process special categories of personal data for the education of children with disabilities, the substantial public interest exception would be an appropriate legal basis. As it might be possible to get explicit consent [paragraph 2, sub-paragraph (a)] to process such data, that option should also be explored in the circumstances. The school will then have to respect the other requirements set in article 9 2) (g). I already discussed the necessity principle in the general commentary below, and I would refer readers to it, as well as the proportionality principle that Union or Member State law must respect. The European or national text must also uphold the \u201cessence of the right to data protection\u201d and offer \u201csuitable and specific measures\u201d to protect the rights and interests of individuals concerned. It is therefore essential for the local authorities to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (article 8) and the principles set out in the GDPR. Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question (h) processing is necessary for the purposes of preventive or occupational medicine, for the assessment of the working capacity of the employee, medical diagnosis, the provision of health or social care or treatment or the management of health or social care systems and services on the basis of Union or Member State law or pursuant to contract with a health professional and subject to the conditions and safeguards referred to in paragraph 3; Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Expert commentary Article 9 2) (h) provides for exceptions to processing data related to medical and social care, which must be necessary (read about the necessity principle in the general commentary below) for: preventive medicine; occupational medicine; assessing the working capacity of employees; medical diagnosis; provision of health or social care or treatment; or management of health or social care systems. It is a list of self-explanatory exceptions and they do not need more exemplification except for the assessing the working capacity of employees exception. It does not overlap with the employment, social security and social protection law exception [sub-paragraph (b)] as it does not concern sensitive data about employees in general, but exclusively data necessary to assess the capacity of an employee to perform her/his job. The assessment can be performed through, for example, drug testing, physical tests or medical exams. The goal is to find out if the person is apt to work in a position that requires specific abilities or a particular health condition. As it is often the case with the GDPR, the legal basis for the exception is to be sought in the Union or Member State law. Knowledge of the European legislation is not enough, you also have to understand the national law of the concerned Member State. The legal basis for the medical and social care exception may equally be found in a contract with a health professional if some conditions and safeguards are respected. Paragraph 3 of article 9 states that the exception is applicable, if based on a contract with a health professional, only if data are processed by a person who is bound by professional secrecy. The conditions and obligations linked to the secrecy can be enumerated in a European Union or national law or established by a national competent body. The definition of health professionals is also left to the Member States. It may include any professionals subject to a duty of confidentiality, like doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians, physiotherapists or social workers. Author Louis-Philippe Gratton PhD, LLM Privacy Expert Ask a question Guidelines & Case Law EDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020). (i) processing is necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health or ensuring high standards of quality and safety of health care and of medicinal products or medical devices, on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject, in particular professional secrecy; Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Expert commentary The difference between the medical and social care [subparagraph (h)] and the public health exceptions is not that obvious and both exceptions may overlap in some cases. The first exception applies to the processing of sensitive data for preventive medicine, for example, whereas the second one affects cross-border threats to health. It is not impossible that the same set of data may be used in one case as well the other for the exact same purpose. The perimeter of article 9 2) (i) is apparently well delimited: it applies to the processing of sensitive data, without the explicit consent of an individual based on subparagraph (a) (recital 54), that are necessary (read about the necessity principle in the general commentary below) for reasons of public interest in the area of public health. Public interest refers to the public good and what is in the best interests of a group of individuals or the society as a whole (recital 53). A personal interest is not enough to justify the application of this exception and once data have been processed under this subparagraph, they cannot be shared with third parties, like employers, insurers or banks (recital 54). Public health is exemplified in article 9 2) (i) itself, but it offers a non-exhaustive list of possible uses. It includes the protection against serious cross-border threats to health and insurance of high standards of quality and safety of health care, medicinal products or medical devices. It encompasses, for example, data necessary to study or fight epidemics or to plan a vaccination program. Public health is further defined as \u201call elements related to health, namely health status, including morbidity and disability, the determinants having an effect on that health status, health care needs, resources allocated to health care, the provision of, and universal access to, health care as well as health care expenditure and financing, and the causes of mortality\u201d [Regulation (EC) No 1338/2008]. Some aspects of that definition are undoubtedly covered by the medical and social care exception [subparagraph (h)], as management of health or social care systems. As it is often the case with the GDPR, the legal basis for the exception is to be sought in the Union or Member State law. Knowledge of the European legislation is not enough, you also have to understand the national law of the concerned Member State. Member States may maintain or introduce further conditions and limitations than those provided for in article 9 2) (i) [article 9 (4) and recital 53]. They should furthermore guarantee individuals\u2019 fundamental rights and the protection of their personal data by law (recitals 53 and 54).

Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Related Expert commentary Exceptions under article 9 2) (j) cover a wide range of interests and they might prove essential for the whole society and future generations. They concern four (4) different spheres: Archives; Scientific research; Historical research; and Statistical. The archiving, research, and statistics exception must respect a list of conditions: Processing must be necessary; It must be based on a Union or Member State law; and The Union or Member State law itself must: be proportionate to the goal pursued; respect the essence of the right to data protection; and guarantee suitable and specific measures to safeguard the fundamental rights and the interests of individuals concerned. I\u2019ve already discussed the necessity principle in the general commentary below, and I would refer readers to it, as well as the proportionality principle that Union or Member State law must respect. The European or national legal text must also uphold the \u201cessence of the right to data protection\u201d and offer \u201csuitable and specific measures\u201d to protect the rights and interests of individuals concerned. It is therefore essential for the local authorities to comply with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (article 8) and the principles set out in the GDPR. Article 89 provides for more specifics on the safeguards and derogations relating to the processing of sensitive data in the context of the archiving, research, and statistics exception, and I invite you to read my comment relating to that provision. As for the archiving exception, you must further demonstrate that the processing is in the public interest. A personal, corporate or financial interest is not enough to justify the application of this exception, you must be able to demonstrate that you are processing special categories of personal data for the public good and in the best interests of a group of individuals or the society as a whole (recital 53). Archives concern public authorities, as well as public or private bodies that \u201chave a legal obligation to acquire, preserve, appraise, arrange, describe, communicate, promote, disseminate and provide access to records\u201d (recital 158). Cold case murder investigations, for example, may justify the archiving of sensitive data in the public interest. Collecting information about political behavior under former totalitarian state regimes or related to genocide and crimes against humanity constitutes a further example (recital 158). Archived data may be used after for different purposes, among them is scientific research (recital 162). Scientific research based on public and private registries may provide deeper knowledge of widespread medical conditions, like cardiovascular disease, cancer or depression (recital 157). Archives may also allow researchers to establish long-term correlations between unemployment or education and other life conditions (recital 157). Knowledge-based policy can thus be implemented to offer better social services or to improve the quality of life of the population (recital 157). The scientific research exception aims at achieving a European research area to encourage the flow of researchers, scientific knowledge and technology [article 179(1) TFEU]. It must be interpreted broadly, according to the GDPR, and it applies to both public-sector and privately funded research (recital 159). Clinical research undertaken in the public interest and meeting the other criteria of subparagraph (j) should be based on this exception rather than on express consent [subparagraph (a) and Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, article 29], recommends the European Data Protection Board (Opinion 3/2019). It is the safest possible ground as research may be compromised if individuals withdraw their consent while the research is conducted or after. A classic example is a pharmaceutical company that conducts clinical trials for a new drug. If it relies on explicit consent [subparagraph (a)], it might face awkward consequences. Individuals participating in the trial might change their minds at the last stage of the research and decide to withdraw their consent. That eventuality would jeopardize the whole process and deprive society of the potential benefits of a new drug. Pharmaceutical companies may give additional guarantees by using anonymized or pseudonymized data in the course of their research to reduce the impact on participants and to compensate for the impossibility to withdraw their consent if the scientific research exception is invoked. Statistical purposes is defined as \u201cany operation of collection and the processing of personal data necessary for statistical surveys or for the production of statistical results\u201d (recital 162). Statistics should be developed, produced and disseminated according to six (6) principles: impartiality, reliability, objectivity, independence, cost-effectiveness, and confidentiality [article 338(2) TFEU]. The collection of stats should result in \u201caggregate data\u201d and not \u201cpersonal data\u201d, which means that they should not concern any particular individuals but constitute abstract data concerning a group of anonymized individuals (recital 162). The statistics thus generated cannot be used to make decisions about any targeted individuals (recital 162). Furthermore, confidential information collected for statistical purposes must be protected with appropriate legal and technical safeguards (recital 163).

Personal or household activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or household activities. (d) by competent authorities for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.

This Regulation should not, therefore, apply to processing activities for those purposes. However, personal data processed by public authorities under this Regulation should, when used for those purposes, be governed by a more specific Union legal act, namely Directive (EU) 2016/680 of the European Parliament and of the Council [7]. Member States may entrust competent authorities within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/680 with tasks which are not necessarily carried out for the purposes of the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and prevention of threats to public security, so that the processing of personal data for those other purposes, in so far as it is within the scope of Union law, falls within the scope of this Regulation. With regard to the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for purposes falling within scope of this Regulation, Member States should be able to maintain or introduce more specific provisions to adapt the application of the rules of this Regulation. Such provisions may determine more precisely specific requirements for the processing of personal data by those competent authorities for those other purposes, taking into account the constitutional, organisational and administrative structure of the respective Member State. When the processing of personal data by private bodies falls within the scope of this Regulation, this Regulation should provide for the possibility for Member States under specific conditions to restrict by law certain obligations and rights when such a restriction constitutes a necessary and proportionate measure in a democratic society to safeguard specific important interests including public security and the prevention, investigation, detection or prosecution of criminal offences or the execution of criminal penalties, including the safeguarding against and the prevention of threats to public security.

This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the Union or not.

Case Law CJEU, Google Spain SL/Agencia espa\u00f1ola de protecci\u00f3n de datos, C-131/12 (2014): 55. In the light of that objective of Directive 95/46 and of the wording of Article 4(1)(a), it must be held that the processing of personal data for the purposes of the service of a search engine such as Google Search, which is operated by an undertaking that has its seat in a third State but has an establishment in a Member State, is carried out \u2018in the context of the activities\u2019 of that establishment if the latter is intended to promote and sell, in that Member State, advertising space offered by the search engine which serves to make the service offered by that engine profitable. 56. In such circumstances, the activities of the operator of the search engine and those of its establishment situated in the Member State concerned are inextricably linked since the activities relating to the advertising space constitute the means of rendering the search engine at issue economically profitable and that engine is, at the same time, the means enabling those activities to be performed. (page 14) CJEU, Unabh\u00e4ngiges Landeszentrum f\u00fcr Datenschutz Schleswig-Holstein/Wirtschaftsakademie Schleswig-Holstein GmbH, C-210/16 (2018): \u2026 where an undertaking established outside the European Union has several establishments in different Member States, the supervisory authority of a Member State is entitled to exercise the powers conferred on it by Article 28(3) of that directive with respect to an establishment of that undertaking situated in the territory of that Member State even if, as a result of the division of tasks within the group, first, that establishment is responsible solely for the sale of advertising space and other marketing activities in the territory of that Member State and, second, exclusive responsibility for collecting and processing personal data belongs, for the entire territory of the European Union, to an establishment situated in another Member State. (page 14) Recitals (22) Any processing of personal data in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor in the Union should be carried out in accordance with this Regulation, regardless of whether the processing itself takes place within the Union. Establishment implies the effective and real exercise of activity through stable arrangements. The legal form of such arrangements, whether through a branch or a subsidiary with a legal personality, is not the determining factor in that respect. (14) The protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data. This Regulation does not cover the processing of personal data which concerns legal persons and in particular undertakings established as legal persons, including the name and the form of the legal person and the contact details of the legal person. Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) \u201cAn establishment in the Union\u201d The threshold for \u201cstable arrangement [9]\u201d can actually be quite low when the centre of activities of a controller concerns the provision of services online. As a result, in some circumstances, the presence of one single employee or agent of a non-EU entity in the Union may be sufficient to constitute a stable arrangement (amounting to an \u2018establishment\u2019 for the purposes of Art 3(1)) if that employee or agent acts with a sufficient degree of stability. Conversely, when an employee is based in the EU but the processing is not being carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee in the Union (i.e. the processing relates to activities of the controller outside the EU), the mere presence of an employee in the EU will not result in that processing falling within the scope of the GDPR. In other words, the mere presence of an employee in the EU is not as such sufficient to trigger the application of the GDPR, since for the processing in question to fall within the scope of the GDPR, it must also be carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee. [9] Weltimmo, paragraph 31. The fact that the non-EU entity responsible for the data processing does not have a branch or subsidiary in a Member State does not preclude it from having an establishment there within the meaning of EU data protection law. Although the notion of establishment is broad, it is not without limits. It is not possible to conclude that the non-EU entity has an establishment in the Union merely because the undertaking\u2019s website is accessible in the Union [10]. [10] CJEU, Verein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation v. Amazon EU Sarl, Case C\u2011191/15, 28 July 2016, paragraph 76 (hereafter \u201cVerein f\u00fcr Konsumenteninformation\u201d). Processing of personal data carried out \u201cin the context of the activities of\u201d an establishment The EDPB considers that, for the purpose of Article 3(1), the meaning of \u201cprocessing in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor\u201d is to be understood in light of the relevant case law. On the one hand, with a view to fulfilling the objective of ensuring effective and complete protection, the meaning of \u201cin the context of the activities of an establishment\u201d cannot be interpreted restrictively [12]. On the other hand, the existence of an establishment within the meaning of the GDPR should not be interpreted too broadly to conclude that the existence of any presence in the EU with even the remotest links to the data processing activities of a non-EU entity will be sufficient to bring this processing within the scope of EU data protection law. Some commercial activity carried out by a non-EU entity within a Member State may indeed be so far removed from the processing of personal data by this entity that the existence of the commercial activity in the EU would not be sufficient to bring the data processing by the non-EU entity within the scope of EU data protection law [13]. [12] Weltimmo, paragraph 25 and Google Spain, paragraph 53. [13] G29 WP 179 update \u2013 Update of Opinion 8/2010 on applicable law in light of the CJEU judgment in Google Spain, 16th December 2015 Consideration of the following two factors may help to determine whether the processing is being carried out by a controller or processor in the context of its establishment in the Union i) Relationship between a data controller or processor outside the Union and its local establishment in the Union The data processing activities of a data controller or processor established outside the EU may be inextricably linked to the activities of a local establishment in a Member State, and thereby may trigger the applicability of EU law, even if that local establishment is not actually taking any role in the data processing itself [14]. If a case by case analysis on the facts shows that there is an inextricable link between the processing of personal data carried out by a non-EU controller or processor and the activities of an EU establishment, EU law will apply to that processing by the non-EU entity, whether or not the EU establishment plays a role in that processing of data [15]. [14] CJEU, Google Spain, Case C\u2011131/12 [15] G29 WP 179 update \u2013 Update of Opinion 8/2010 on applicable law in light of the CJEU judgment in Google Spain, 16th December 2015 ii) Revenue raising in the Union Revenue-raising in the EU by a local establishment, to the extent that such activities can be considered as \u201cinextricably linked\u201d to the processing of personal data taking place outside the EU and individuals in the EU, may be indicative of processing by a non-EU controller or processor being carried out \u201cin the context of the activities of the EU establishment\u201d, and may be sufficient to result in the application of EU law to such processing [16]. [16] This may potentially be the case, for example, for any foreign operator with a sales office or some other presence in the EU, even if that office has no role in the actual data processing, in particular where the processing takes place in the context of the sales activity in the EU and the activities of the establishment are aimed at the inhabitants of the Member States in which the establishment is located (WP179 update). 2. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union, where the processing activities are related to: Related Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Data subjects in the Union The wording of Article 3(2) refers to \u201cpersonal data of data subjects who are in the Union\u201d. The application of the targeting criterion is therefore not limited by the citizenship, residence or other type of legal status of the data subject whose personal data are being processed. Recital 14 confirms this interpretation and states that \u201c[t]he protection afforded by this Regulation should apply to natural persons, whatever their nationality or place of residence, in relation to the processing of their personal data\u201d. While the location of the data subject in the territory of the Union is a determining factor for the application of the targeting criterion as per Article 3(2), the EDPB considers that the nationality or legal status of a data subject who is in the Union cannot limit or restrict the territorial scope of the Regulation. The requirement that the data subject be located in the Union must be assessed at the moment when the relevant trigger activity takes place, i.e. at the moment of offering of goods or services or the moment when the behaviour is being monitored, regardless of the duration of the offer made or monitoring undertaken. (a) the offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to such data subjects in the Union; or Recitals Related Recitals (23) In order to ensure that natural persons are not deprived of the protection to which they are entitled under this Regulation, the processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or a processor not established in the Union should be subject to this Regulation where the processing activities are related to offering goods or services to such data subjects irrespective of whether connected to a payment. In order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union. Whereas the mere accessibility of the controller's, processor's or an intermediary's website in the Union, of an email address or of other contact details, or the use of a language generally used in the third country where the controller is established, is insufficient to ascertain such intention, factors such as the use of a language or a currency generally used in one or more Member States with the possibility of ordering goods and services in that other language, or the mentioning of customers or users who are in the Union, may make it apparent that the controller envisages offering goods or services to data subjects in the Union. Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Offering of goods or services, irrespective of whether a payment of the data subject is required, to data subjects in the Union The first activity triggering the application of Article 3(2) is the \u201coffering of goods or services\u201d, a concept which has been further addressed by EU law and case law, which should be taken into account when applying the targeting criterion. The offering of services also includes the offering of information society services, defined in point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 [23] as \u201cany Information Society service, that is to say, any service normally provided for remuneration, at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services\u201d. [23] Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 September 2015 laying down a procedure for the provision of information in the field of technical regulations and of rules on Information Society services. Another key element to be assessed in determining whether the Article 3(2)(a) targeting criterion can be met is whether the offer of goods or services is directed at a person in the Union, or in other words, whether the conduct on the part of the controller, which determines the means and purposes of processing, demonstrates its intention to offer goods or a services to a data subject located in the Union. Recital 23 of the GDPR indeed clarifies that \u201cin order to determine whether such a controller or processor is offering goods or services to data subjects who are in the Union, it should be ascertained whether it is apparent that the controller or processor envisages offering services to data subjects in one or more Member States in the Union.\u201d The elements listed in Recital 23 echo and are in line with the CJEU case law based on Council Regulation 44/2001 [25] on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, and in particular its Article 15(1)(c). In Pammer v Reederei Karl Schl\u00fcter GmbH & Co and Hotel Alpenhof v Heller (Joined cases C-585/08 and C-144/09), the Court was asked to clarify what it means to \u201cdirect activity\u201d within the meaning of Article 15(1)(c) of Regulation 44/2001 (Brussels I). The CJEU held that, in order to determine whether a trader can be considered to be \u201cdirecting\u201d its activity to the Member State of the consumer\u2019s domicile, within the meaning of Article 15(1)(c) of Brussels I, the trader must have manifested its intention to establish commercial relations with such consumers. In this context, the CJEU considered evidence able to demonstrate that the trader was envisaging doing business with consumers domiciled in a Member State. [25] Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. While the notion of \u201cdirecting an activity\u201d differs from the \u201coffering of goods or services\u201d, the EDPB deems this case law in in Pammer v Reederei Karl Schl\u00fcter GmbH & Co and Hotel Alpenhof v Heller (Joined cases C-585/08 and C-144/09) [26] might be of assistance when considering whether goods or services are offered to a data subject in the Union. When taking into account the specific facts of the case, the following factors could therefore inter alia be taken into consideration, possibly in combination with one another: [26] It is all the more relevant that, under Article 6 of Regulation (EC) No 593/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 June 2008 on the law applicable to contractual obligations (Rome I), in absence of choice of law, this criterion of \u201cdirecting activity\u201d to the country of the consumer\u2019s habitual residence is taken into account to designate the law of the consumer\u2019s habitual residence as the law applicable to the contract. \u2013 The EU or at least one Member State is designated by name with reference to the good or service offered; \u2013 The data controller or processor pays a search engine operator for an internet referencing service in order to facilitate access to its site by consumers in the Union; or the controller or processor has launched marketing and advertisement campaigns directed at an EU country audience \u2013 The international nature of the activity at issue, such as certain tourist activities; \u2013 The mention of dedicated addresses or phone numbers to be reached from an EU country; \u2013 The use of a top-level domain name other than that of the third country in which the controller or processor is established, for example \u201c.de\u201d, or the use of neutral top-level domain names such as \u201c.eu\u201d; \u2013 The description of travel instructions from one or more other EU Member States to the place where the service is provided; \u2013 The mention of an international clientele composed of customers domiciled in various EU Member States, in particular by presentation of accounts written by such customers; \u2013 The use of a language or a currency other than that generally used in the trader\u2019s country, especially a language or currency of one or more EU Member states; \u2013 The data controller offers the delivery of goods in EU Member States. (b) the monitoring of their behaviour as far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. Recitals Related Recitals (24) The processing of personal data of data subjects who are in the Union by a controller or processor not established in the Union should also be subject to this Regulation when it is related to the monitoring of the behaviour of such data subjects in so far as their behaviour takes place within the Union. In order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes. Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Monitoring of data subjects\u2019 behaviour For Article 3(2)(b) to trigger the application of the GDPR, the behaviour monitored must first relate to a data subject in the Union and, as a cumulative criterion, the monitored behaviour must take place within the territory of the Union. The nature of the processing activity which can be considered as behavioural monitoring is further specified in Recital 24 which states that \u201cin order to determine whether a processing activity can be considered to monitor the behaviour of data subjects, it should be ascertained whether natural persons are tracked on the internet including potential subsequent use of personal data processing techniques which consist of profiling a natural person, particularly in order to take decisions concerning her or him or for analysing or predicting her or his personal preferences, behaviours and attitudes.\u201d While Recital 24 exclusively relates to the monitoring of a behaviour through the tracking of a person on the internet, the EDPB considers that tracking through other types of network or technology involving personal data processing should also be taken into account in determining whether a processing activity amounts to a behavioural monitoring, for example through wearable and other smart devices. As opposed to the provision of Article 3(2)(a), neither Article 3(2)(b) nor Recital 24 expressly introduce a necessary degree of \u201cintention to target\u201d on the part of the data controller or processor to determine whether the monitoring activity would trigger the application of the GDPR to the processing activities. However, the use of the word \u201cmonitoring\u201d implies that the controller has a specific purpose in mind for the collection and subsequent reuse of the relevant data about an individual\u2019s behaviour within the EU. The EDPB does not consider that any online collection or analysis of personal data of individuals in the EU would automatically count as \u201cmonitoring\u201d. It will be necessary to consider the controller\u2019s purpose for processing the data and, in particular, any subsequent behavioural analysis or profiling techniques involving that data. The EDPB takes into account the wording of Recital 24, which indicates that to determine whether processing involves monitoring of a data subject behaviour, the tracking of natural persons on the Internet, including the potential subsequent use of profiling techniques, is a key consideration. The application of Article 3(2)(b) where a data controller or processor monitors the behaviour of data subjects who are in the Union could therefore encompass a broad range of monitoring activities, including in particular: \u2013 Behavioural advertisement \u2013 Geo-localisation activities, in particular for marketing purposes \u2013 Online tracking through the use of cookies or other tracking techniques such as fingerprinting \u2013 Personalised diet and health analytics services online \u2013 CCTV \u2013 Market surveys and other behavioural studies based on individual profiles \u2013 Monitoring or regular reporting on an individual\u2019s health status 3. This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data by a controller not established in the Union, but in a place where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law. Recitals Recitals (25) Where Member State law applies by virtue of public international law, this Regulation should also apply to a controller not established in the Union, such as in a Member State\u2019s diplomatic mission or consular post.",

Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 1/2008 on data protection issues related to search engines (2008). Data outlining the use of the service can be divided into different categories: the query logs (content of the search queries, the date and time, source (IP address and cookie), the preferences of the user, and data relating to the user\u2019s computer); data on the content offered (links and advertisements as a result of each query); and data on the subsequent user navigation (clicks). Search engines may also process operational data relating to user data, data on registered users and data from other services and sources such as e-mail, desktop search, and advertising on third party websites. An individual\u2019s search history is personal data if the individual to which it relates, is identifiable Though IP addresses in most cases are not directly identifiable by search engines, identification can be achieved by a third party. Internet access providers hold IP address data. Law enforcement and national security authorities can gain access to these data and in some Member States private parties have gained access also through civil litigation. Thus, in most cases \u2013 including cases with dynamic IP address allocation \u2013 the necessary data will be available to identify the user(s) of the IP address. When a cookie contains a unique user ID, this ID is clearly personal data. ANNEX 1 contains example of data processed by search engines.

EDPB, Guidelines on the use of location data and contact tracing tools in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak (2020): 9. There are two principal sources of location data available for modelling the spread of the virus and the overall effectiveness of confinement measures: \u2013 location data collected by electronic communication service providers(such as mobile telecommunication operators) in the course of the provision of their service; and \u2013 location data collected by information society service providers\u2019 applications whose functionality requires the use of such data (e.g., navigation, transportation services,etc.). EDPB, Guidelines 8/2020 on the targeting of social media users (2020): 18. The term \u201cuser\u201d is typically used to refer to individuals who are registered with the service, i.e. those who have an \u201caccount\u201d or \u201cprofile\u201d. Many social media services can, however, also be accessed by individuals without having registered (i.e. without creating an account or profile). Such individuals are typically not able to make use of all of the same features or services offered to individuals who have registered with the social media provider. Both users and non-registered individuals may be considered \u201cdata subjects\u201d within the meaning of Article 4(1) GDPR insofar as the individual is directly or indirectly identified or identifiable.

Recitals (26) The principles of data protection should apply to any information concerning an identified or identifiable natural person. Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person. To determine whether a natural person is identifiable, account should be taken of all the means reasonably likely to be used, such as singling out, either by the controller or by another person to identify the natural person directly or indirectly. To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments. The principles of data protection should therefore not apply to anonymous information, namely information which does not relate to an identified or identifiable natural person or to personal data rendered anonymous in such a manner that the data subject is not or no longer identifiable. This Regulation does not therefore concern the processing of such anonymous information, including for statistical or research purposes. (2) \u2018processing\u2019 means any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction; Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Expert commentary Though GDPR Art.4(2) does not mention \u201cpurpose\u201d, a \u201cprocessing\u201d should actually be understood as an operation or set of operations united by one purpose. The purpose determines the role of data controller, legal ground for processing, defines the exception allowing for the processing of special categories of data, it limits processing to one purpose (purpose limitation principle), serves as a criteria for data minimisation, and determines a risk level and scope of data subject rights. Some operations may serve multiple purposes, for instance, storage of email addresses allows a company to provide login to its website (purpose 1) and to send marketing communications (purpose 2). In that case this operation (storage) is a part of two processing activities at the same time. Stopping one of them (for example as a result of a withdrawal of consent for marketing emails) does not prevent company from continuing the another one (allowing the user to login).

Data Protection Trainer and Principal Consultant Ask a question Guidelines & Case Law Documents Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2010 on behavioural advertising (2010): The behavioural advertising methods often entail the processing of personal data. This is due to various reasons: i) behavioural advertising normally involves the collection of IP addresses and the processing of unique identifiers (through the cookie). The use of such devices with a unique identifier allows the tracking of users of a specific computer even when dynamic IP addresses are used. In other words, such devices enable data subjects to be \u2018singled out\u2019, even if their real names are not known. ii) Furthermore, the information collected in the context of behavioural advertising relates to, (i.e. is about) a person\u2019s characteristics or behaviour and it is used to influence that particular person. This view is further confirmed if one takes into account the possibility for profiles to be linked at any moment with directly identifiable information provided by the data subject, such as registration related information. DPC (Ireland), Guidance for Organisations Accidentally in Receipt of Personal Data (2020): An organisation, whether in the public, private or voluntary sector, must be aware of the possibility of finding itself accidentally in possession of personal data. The broad definition of \u2018processing\u2019 in Article 4(2) of the GDPR means that opening, transmitting, deleting or simply storing personal data that you have unintentionally acquired will bring the GDPR into play.

(3) \u2018restriction of processing\u2019 means the marking of stored personal data with the aim of limiting their processing in the future; (4) \u2018profiling\u2019 means any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person\u2019s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (2018): Profiling is composed of three elements: it has to be an automated form of processing; it has to be carried out on personal data; and the objective of the profiling must be to evaluate personal aspects about a natural person. Article 4(4) refers to \u2018any form of automated processing\u2019 rather than \u2018solely\u2019 automated processing (referred to in Article 22). Profiling has to involve some form of automated processing \u2013 although human involvement does not necessarily take the activity out of the definition. Profiling is a procedure which may involve a series of statistical deductions. It is often used to make predictions about people, using data from various sources to infer something about an individual, based on the qualities of others who appear statistically similar. The GDPR says that profiling is automated processing of personal data for evaluating personal aspects, in particular to analyse or make predictions about individuals. The use of the word \u2018evaluating\u2019 suggests that profiling involves some form of assessment or judgement about a person. A simple classification of individuals based on known characteristics such as their age, sex, and height does not necessarily lead to profiling. This will depend on the purpose of the classification. For instance, a business may wish to classify its customers according to their age or gender for statistical purposes and to acquire an aggregated overview of its clients without making any predictions or drawing any conclusion about an individual. In this case, the purpose is not assessing individual characteristics and is therefore not profiling. The GDPR is inspired by but is not identical to the definition of profiling in the Council of Europe Recommendation CM/Rec (2010)132 (the Recommendation), as the Recommendation excludes processing that does not include inference. Nevertheless the Recommendation usefully explains that profiling may involve three distinct stages: data collection; automated analysis to identify correlations; applying the correlation to an individual to identify characteristics of present or future behaviour. Controllers carrying out profiling will need to ensure they meet the GDPR requirements in respect of all of the above stages. Broadly speaking, profiling means gathering information about an individual (or group of individuals) and evaluating their characteristics or behaviour patterns in order to place them into a certain category or group, in particular to analyse and/or make predictions about, for example, their: ability to perform a task; interests; or likely behaviour. (5) \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 means the processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information, provided that such additional information is kept separately and is subject to technical and organisational measures to ensure that the personal data are not attributed to an identified or identifiable natural person; Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Expert commentary (RU) \u041f\u0441\u0435\u0432\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0437\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 GDPR \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u0438\u0447\u0435\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u044f\u0432\u043b\u044f\u0435\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435\u043c \u0432 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438, \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u044f\u0442\u043e\u043c \u0432 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0439\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438. \u0412 \u0441\u043e\u043e\u0442\u0432\u0435\u0442\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u0438 \u0441\u043e \u0441\u0442.3 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0437\u0430\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0430 \u043e\u0442 27.07.2006 N 152-\u0424\u0417 \u201c\u041e \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445\u201d (\u0440\u0435\u0434. \u043e\u0442 31.12.2017) \u201c\u043e\u0431\u0435\u0437\u043b\u0438\u0447\u0438\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u2013 \u0434\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0438\u044f, \u0432 \u0440\u0435\u0437\u0443\u043b\u044c\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0435 \u043a\u043e\u0442\u043e\u0440\u044b\u0445 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0442\u0441\u044f \u043d\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0437\u043c\u043e\u0436\u043d\u044b\u043c \u0431\u0435\u0437 \u0438\u0441\u043f\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0437\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0434\u043e\u043f\u043e\u043b\u043d\u0438\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u0438\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043e\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0430\u0434\u043b\u0435\u0436\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u043a\u043e\u043d\u043a\u0440\u0435\u0442\u043d\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u0441\u0443\u0431\u044a\u0435\u043a\u0442\u0443 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0441\u043e\u043d\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0445 \u0434\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0445\u201d (\u0412\u044b\u0434\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0435 \u2013 \u0421\u0412).

The explicit introduction of \u2018pseudonymisation\u2019 in this Regulation is not intended to preclude any other measures of data protection. (29) In order to create incentives to apply pseudonymisation when processing personal data, measures of pseudonymisation should, whilst allowing general analysis, be possible within the same controller when that controller has taken technical and organisational measures necessary to ensure, for the processing concerned, that this Regulation is implemented, and that additional information for attributing the personal data to a specific data subject is kept separately. The controller processing the personal data should indicate the authorised persons within the same controller.

This Regulation applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data which form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system. (7) \u2018controller\u2019 means the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law; Expert commentary Guidelines & Case Law Expert commentary Examples from the British supervisory authority (ICO): A specialist company provides software and data analysis to process the daily pupil attendance records of a state-maintained school for an annual fee. For the software provision the company is not a processor, but for the data analysis it is a processor for the school. The readers of a monthly science magazine receive a hard copy delivered to their home. Their subscriptions and the mailings are handled by a separate company at the publisher\u2019s request. The company is a processor for the magazine publisher. A marketing company sends promotional vouchers to a hairdresser\u2019s customers on the hairdresser\u2019s behalf.

Guidelines & Case Law Document Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 1/2008 on data protection issues related to search engines (2008). A search engine provider that processes user data including IP addresses and/or persistent cookies containing a unique identifier falls within the material scope of the definition of the controller, since he effectively determines the purposes and means of the processing. Article 29 Working Party, Opinion 2/2010 on behavioural advertising (2010): When behavioural advertising entails the processing of personal data, ad network providers also play the role of data controller. Ad network providers have complete control over the purposes and means of the processing. However, the publishers\u2019 responsibility covers the first stage, i.e. the initial part of the data processing, namely the transfer of the IP address that takes place when individuals visit their websites. This is because the publishers facilitate such transfer and co-determine the purposes for which it is carried out, i.e. to serve visitors with tailored adverting. In sum, for these reasons, publishers will have some responsibility as data controllers for these actions.

Recitals (32) Consent should be given by a clear affirmative act establishing a freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her, such as by a written statement, including by electronic means, or an oral statement. This could include ticking a box when visiting an internet website, choosing technical settings for information society services or another statement or conduct which clearly indicates in this context the data subject's acceptance of the proposed processing of his or her personal data. Silence, pre-ticked boxes or inactivity should not therefore constitute consent. Consent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them. If the data subject's consent is to be given following a request by electronic means, the request must be clear, concise and not unnecessarily disruptive to the use of the service for which it is provided. (33) It is often not possible to fully identify the purpose of personal data processing for scientific research purposes at the time of data collection. Therefore, data subjects should be allowed to give their consent to certain areas of scientific research when in keeping with recognised ethical standards for scientific research. Data subjects should have the opportunity to give their consent only to certain areas of research or parts of research projects to the extent allowed by the intended purpose. Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 Free / freely given [12] 13. The element \u201cfree\u201d implies real choice and control for data subjects. As a general rule, the GDPR prescribes that if the data subject has no real choice, feels compelled to consent or will endure negative consequences if they do not consent, then consent will not be valid. [13] If consent is bundled up as a non-negotiable part of terms and conditions it is presumed not to have been freely given. Accordingly, consent will not be considered to be free if the data subject is unable to refuse or withdraw his or her consent without detriment. [14] The notion of imbalance between the controller and the data subject is also taken into consideration by the GDPR. [13] See Opinion 15/2011 on the definition of consent (WP187), p. 12 [14] See Recitals 42, 43 GDPR and WP29 Opinion 15/2011 on the definition of consent, adopted on 13 July 2011, (WP 187), p. 12. 14. When assessing whether consent is freely given, one should also take into account the specific situation of tying consent into contracts or the provision of a service as described in Article 7(4). Article 7(4) has been drafted in a non-exhaustive fashion by the words \u201cinter alia\u201d, meaning that there may be a range of other situations which are caught by this provision. In general terms, any element of inappropriate pressure or influence upon the data subject (which may be manifested in many different ways) which prevents a data subject from exercising their free will, shall render the consent invalid. 43. Recital 43 clarifies that consent is presumed not to be freely given if the process/procedure for obtaining consent does not allow data subjects to give separate consent for personal data processing operations respectively (e.g. only for some processing operations and not for others) despite it being appropriate in the individual case. Recital 32 states \u201cConsent should cover all processing activities carried out for the same purpose or purposes. When the processing has multiple purposes, consent should be given for all of them\u201d. Minimum content requirements for consent to be \u2018informed\u2019 64. For consent to be informed, it is necessary to inform the data subject of certain elements that are crucial to make a choice. Therefore, the EDPB is of the opinion that at least the following information is required for obtaining valid consent: i. the controller\u2019s identity, [30] ii. the purpose of each of the processing operations for which consent is sought,[31] iii. what (type of) data will be collected and used, [32] iv. the existence of the right to withdraw consent,[33] v. information about the use of the data for automated decision-making in accordance with Article 22 (2)(c)[34] where relevant, and vi. on the possible risks of data transfers due to absence of an adequacy decision and of appropriate safeguards as described in Article 46.[35] [30] See also Recital 42 GDPR: \u201c [\u2026]For consent to be informed, the data subject should be aware at least of the identity of the controller and the purposes of the processing for which the personal data are intended.[\u2026].\u201d [31] Again, see Recital 42 GDPR [32] See also WP29 Opinion 15/2011 on the definition of consent (WP 187) pp.19-20 [33] See Article 7(3) GDPR [34] See also WP29 Guidelines on Automated individual decision-making and Profiling for the purposes of Regulation 2016/679 (WP251), paragraph IV.B, p. 20 onwards. [35] Pursuant to Article 49 (1)(a), specific information is required about the absence of safeguards described in Article 46, when explicit consent is sought. See also WP29 Opinion 15/2011 on the definition of consent (WP 187)p. 19 Unambiguous indication of wishes 75. The GDPR is clear that consent requires a statement from the data subject or a clear affirmative act which means that it must always be given through an active motion or declaration. It must be obvious that the data subject has consented to the particular processing. 77. A \u201cclear affirmative act\u201d means that the data subject must have taken a deliberate action to consent to the particular processing.[41] Recital 32 sets out additional guidance on this. Consent can be collected through a written or (a recorded) oral statement, including by electronic means. [41] See Commission Staff Working Paper, Impact Assessment, Annex 2, p. 20 and also pp. 105-106: \u201cAs also pointed out in the opinion adopted by WP29 on consent, it seems essential to clarify that valid consent requires the use of mechanisms that leave no doubt of the data subject\u2019s intention to consent, while making clear that \u2013 in the context of the on-line environment \u2013 the use of default options which the data subject is required to modify in order to reject the processing (\u2018consent based on silence\u2019) does not in itself constitute unambiguous consent. This would give individuals more control over their own data, whenever processing is based on his/her consent. As regards impact on data controllers, this would not have a major impact as it solely clarifies and better spells out the implications of the current Directive in relation to the conditions for a valid and meaningful consent from the data subject. In particular, to the extent that \u2018explicit\u2019 consent would clarify \u2013 by replacing \u201cunambiguous\u201d \u2013 the modalities and quality of consent and that it is not intended to extend the cases and situations where (explicit) consent should be used as a ground for processing, the impact of this measure on data controllers is not expected to be major.\u201d (12) \u2018personal data breach\u2019 means a breach of security leading to the accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise processed; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Personal Data Breach Notification Under Regulation 2016/679 (2018): In its Opinion 03/2014 on breach notification, WP29 explained that breaches can be categorised according to the following three well-known information security principles: \u2013 \u201cConfidentiality breach\u201d \u2013 where there is an unauthorised or accidental disclosure of, or access to, personal data. \u2013 \u201cIntegrity breach\u201d \u2013 where there is an unauthorised or accidental alteration of personal data. \u2013 \u201cAvailability breach\u201d \u2013 where there is an accidental or unauthorised loss of access to, or destruction of, personal data. (13) \u2018genetic data\u2019 means personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which give unique information about the physiology or the health of that natural person and which result, in particular, from an analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question; Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Guidelines & Case Law Article 29 Working Party, Working Document on Genetic Data (2004). Recitals (34) Genetic data should be defined as personal data relating to the inherited or acquired genetic characteristics of a natural person which result from the analysis of a biological sample from the natural person in question, in particular chromosomal, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis, or from the analysis of another element enabling equivalent information to be obtained. (14) \u2018biometric data\u2019 means personal data resulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, which allow or confirm the unique identification of that natural person, such as facial images or dactyloscopic data; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law To qualify as biometric data as defined in the GDPR, processing of raw data, such as the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, must imply a measurement of this characteristics. Since biometric data is the result of such measurements, the GDPR states in its Article 4.14 that it is \u201cresulting from specific technical processing relating to the physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics\u201d.The video footage of an individual cannot however in itself be considered as biometric data under Article 9, if it has not been specifically technically processed in order to contribute to the identification of an individual. In order for it to be considered as processing of special categories of personal data (Article 9) it requires that biometric data is processed \u201cfor the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person\u201d. To sum up, in light of Article 4.14 and 9, three criteria must be considered: \u2014 Nature of data: data relating to physical, physiological or behavioural characteristics of a natural person, \u2014 Means and way of processing: data \u201cresulting from a specific technical processing\u201d, \u2014 Purpose of processing: data must be used for the purpose to uniquely identifying a natural person.

(15) \u2018data concerning health\u2019 means personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status; Guidelines & Case Law Recitals Guidelines & Case Law Documents EDPB, Guidelines 3/2020 on the Processing of Data Concerning Health for the Purpose of Scientific Research in the Context of the Covid-19 Outbreak, (2020). Recitals (35) Personal data concerning health should include all data pertaining to the health status of a data subject which reveal information relating to the past, current or future physical or mental health status of the data subject. This includes information about the natural person collected in the course of the registration for, or the provision of, health care services as referred to in Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council [9] to that natural person; a number, symbol or particular assigned to a natural person to uniquely identify the natural person for health purposes; information derived from the testing or examination of a body part or bodily substance, including from genetic data and biological samples; and any information on, for example, a disease, disability, disease risk, medical history, clinical treatment or the physiological or biomedical state of the data subject independent of its source, for example from a physician or other health professional, a hospital, a medical device or an in vitro diagnostic test. [9] Directive 2011/24/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 March 2011 on the application of patients' rights in cross-border healthcare (OJ L 88, 4.4.2011, p. 45). https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2011:088:TOC (16) \u2018main establishment\u2019 means: Recitals Recitals (36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking. (a) as regards a controller with establishments in more than one Member State, the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union and the latter establishment has the power to have such decisions implemented, in which case the establishment having taken such decisions is to be considered to be the main establishment; (b) as regards a processor with establishments in more than one Member State, the place of its central administration in the Union, or, if the processor has no central administration in the Union, the establishment of the processor in the Union where the main processing activities in the context of the activities of an establishment of the processor take place to the extent that the processor is subject to specific obligations under this Regulation; Related Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) Processing of personal data carried out \u201cin the context of the activities of\u201d an establishment The EDPB considers that, for the purpose of Article 3(1), the meaning of \u201cprocessing in the context of the activities of an establishment of a controller or a processor\u201d is to be understood in light of the relevant case law. On the one hand, with a view to fulfilling the objective of ensuring effective and complete protection, the meaning of \u201cin the context of the activities of an establishment\u201d cannot be interpreted restrictively [12]. On the other hand, the existence of an establishment within the meaning of the GDPR should not be interpreted too broadly to conclude that the existence of any presence in the EU with even the remotest links to the data processing activities of a non-EU entity will be sufficient to bring this processing within the scope of EU data protection law. Some commercial activity carried out by a non-EU entity within a Member State may indeed be so far removed from the processing of personal data by this entity that the existence of the commercial activity in the EU would not be sufficient to bring the data processing by the non-EU entity within the scope of EU data protection law [13].

[13] G29 WP 179 update \u2013 Update of Opinion 8/2010 on applicable law in light of the CJEU judgment in Google Spain, 16th December 2015 Consideration of the following two factors may help to determine whether the processing is being carried out by a controller or processor in the context of its establishment in the Union i) Relationship between a data controller or processor outside the Union and its local establishment in the Union The data processing activities of a data controller or processor established outside the EU may be inextricably linked to the activities of a local establishment in a Member State, and thereby may trigger the applicability of EU law, even if that local establishment is not actually taking any role in the data processing itself [14]. If a case by case analysis on the facts shows that there is an inextricable link between the processing of personal data carried out by a non-EU controller or processor and the activities of an EU establishment, EU law will apply to that processing by the non-EU entity, whether or not the EU establishment plays a role in that processing of data [15].

[16] This may potentially be the case, for example, for any foreign operator with a sales office or some other presence in the EU, even if that office has no role in the actual data processing, in particular where the processing takes place in the context of the sales activity in the EU and the activities of the establishment are aimed at the inhabitants of the Member States in which the establishment is located (WP179 update). (17) \u2018representative\u2019 means a natural or legal person established in the Union who, designated by the controller or processor in writing pursuant to Article 27, represents the controller or processor with regard to their respective obligations under this Regulation; Related Related Article 27 GDPR. Representatives of controllers or processors not established in the Union 1. Where Article 3(2) applies, the controller or the processor shall designate in writing a representative in the Union. [\u2026] 3. The representative shall be established in one of the Member States where the data subjects, whose personal data are processed in relation to the offering of goods or services to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are. 4. The representative shall be mandated by the controller or processor to be addressed in addition to or instead of the controller or the processor by, in particular, supervisory authorities and data subjects, on all issues related to processing, for the purposes of ensuring compliance with this Regulation. 5. The designation of a representative by the controller or processor shall be without prejudice to legal actions which could be initiated against the controller or the processor themselves. (18) \u2018enterprise\u2019 means a natural or legal person engaged in an economic activity, irrespective of its legal form, including partnerships or associations regularly engaged in an economic activity; (19) \u2018group of undertakings\u2019 means a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings; Expert commentary Recitals Expert commentary In order to impose fines that are effective, proportionate and dissuasive, the supervisory authority shall use for the definition of the notion of an undertaking as provided for by the CJEU for the purposes of the application of Article 101 and 102 TFEU, namely that the concept of an undertaking is understood to mean an economic unit, which may be formed by the parent company and all involved subsidiaries. In accordance with EU law and case-law*, an undertaking must be understood to be the economic unit, which engages in commercial/economic activities, regardless of the legal person involved (Recital 150) * The ECJ case law definition is: \u00abthe concept of an undertaking encompasses every entity engaged in an economic activity regardless of the legal status of the entity and the way in which it is financed\u201d (Case H\u00f6fner and Elsner, para 21, ECLI:EU:C:1991:161). An undertaking \u00abmust be understood as designating an economic unit even if in law that economic unit consists of several persons, natural or legal\u00bb (Case Confederaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1ola de Empresarios de Estaciones de Servicio [para 40, ECLI:EU:C:2006:784) Art29WP, Guidelines on the application and setting of administrative fines for the purpose of the Regulation 2016/679, wp253 (2017) Recitals (37) A group of undertakings should cover a controlling undertaking and its controlled undertakings, whereby the controlling undertaking should be the undertaking which can exert a dominant influence over the other undertakings by virtue, for example, of ownership, financial participation or the rules which govern it or the power to have personal data protection rules implemented. An undertaking which controls the processing of personal data in undertakings affiliated to it should be regarded, together with those undertakings, as a group of undertakings. (20) \u2018binding corporate rules\u2019 means personal data protection policies which are adhered to by a controller or processor established on the territory of a Member State for transfers or a set of transfers of personal data to a controller or processor in one or more third countries within a group of undertakings, or group of enterprises engaged in a joint economic activity; (21) \u2018supervisory authority\u2019 means an independent public authority which is established by a Member State pursuant to Article 51; (22) \u2018supervisory authority concerned\u2019 means a supervisory authority which is concerned by the processing of personal data because: Recitals Recitals (36) The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be the place of its central administration in the Union, unless the decisions on the purposes and means of the processing of personal data are taken in another establishment of the controller in the Union, in which case that other establishment should be considered to be the main establishment. The main establishment of a controller in the Union should be determined according to objective criteria and should imply the effective and real exercise of management activities determining the main decisions as to the purposes and means of processing through stable arrangements. That criterion should not depend on whether the processing of personal data is carried out at that location. The presence and use of technical means and technologies for processing personal data or processing activities do not, in themselves, constitute a main establishment and are therefore not determining criteria for a main establishment. The main establishment of the processor should be the place of its central administration in the Union or, if it has no central administration in the Union, the place where the main processing activities take place in the Union. In cases involving both the controller and the processor, the competent lead supervisory authority should remain the supervisory authority of the Member State where the controller has its main establishment, but the supervisory authority of the processor should be considered to be a supervisory authority concerned and that supervisory authority should participate in the cooperation procedure provided for by this Regulation. In any case, the supervisory authorities of the Member State or Member States where the processor has one or more establishments should not be considered to be supervisory authorities concerned where the draft decision concerns only the controller. Where the processing is carried out by a group of undertakings, the main establishment of the controlling undertaking should be considered to be the main establishment of the group of undertakings, except where the purposes and means of processing are determined by another undertaking. (a) the controller or processor is established on the territory of the Member State of that supervisory authority; (b) data subjects residing in the Member State of that supervisory authority are substantially affected or likely to be substantially affected by the processing; or (c) a complaint has been lodged with that supervisory authority; (23) \u2018cross-border processing\u2019 means either: (a) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of establishments in more than one Member State of a controller or processor in the Union where the controller or processor is established in more than one Member State; or (b) processing of personal data which takes place in the context of the activities of a single establishment of a controller or processor in the Union but which substantially affects or is likely to substantially affect data subjects in more than one Member State. Related Related Guidelines 3/2018 on the territorial scope of the GDPR (Article 3) \u201cAn establishment in the Union\u201d The threshold for \u201cstable arrangement [9]\u201d can actually be quite low when the centre of activities of a controller concerns the provision of services online. As a result, in some circumstances, the presence of one single employee or agent of a non-EU entity in the Union may be sufficient to constitute a stable arrangement (amounting to an \u2018establishment\u2019 for the purposes of Art 3(1)) if that employee or agent acts with a sufficient degree of stability. Conversely, when an employee is based in the EU but the processing is not being carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee in the Union (i.e. the processing relates to activities of the controller outside the EU), the mere presence of an employee in the EU will not result in that processing falling within the scope of the GDPR. In other words, the mere presence of an employee in the EU is not as such sufficient to trigger the application of the GDPR, since for the processing in question to fall within the scope of the GDPR, it must also be carried out in the context of the activities of the EU-based employee. [9] Weltimmo, paragraph 31. The fact that the non-EU entity responsible for the data processing does not have a branch or subsidiary in a Member State does not preclude it from having an establishment there within the meaning of EU data protection law. Although the notion of establishment is broad, it is not without limits. It is not possible to conclude that the non-EU entity has an establishment in the Union merely because the undertaking\u2019s website is accessible in the Union [10].

(24) \u2018relevant and reasoned objection\u2019 means an objection to a draft decision as to whether there is an infringement of this Regulation, or whether envisaged action in relation to the controller or processor complies with this Regulation, which clearly demonstrates the significance of the risks posed by the draft decision as regards the fundamental rights and freedoms of data subjects and, where applicable, the free flow of personal data within the Union; Guidelines & Case Law Guidelines & Case Law Documents EDPB, Guidelines on relevant and reasoned objection under Regulation 2016/679 (2020). (25) \u2018information society service\u2019 means a service as defined in point (b) of Article 1(1) of Directive (EU) 2015/1535 of the European Parliament and of the Council [19]; Related Related Guidelines on consent under Regulation 2016/679 129. While assessing the scope of this definition, the EDPB also refers to case law of the ECJ.[62] The ECJ held that information society services cover contracts and other services that are concluded or transmitted on-line. Where a service has two economically independent components, one being the online component, such as the offer and the acceptance of an offer in the context of the conclusion of a contract or the information relating to products or services, including marketing activities, this component is defined as an information society service, the other component being the physical delivery or distribution of goods is not covered by the notion of an information society service. The online delivery of a service would fall within the scope of the term information society service in Article 8 GDPR. [62] See European Court of Justice, 2 December 2010 Case C-108/09, (Ker-Optika), paragraphs 22 and 28. In relation to \u2018composite services\u2019, the EDPB also refers to Case C-434/15 (Asociacion Profesional Elite Taxi v Uber Systems Spain SL), para 40, which states that an information society service forming an integral part of an overall service whose main component is not an information society service (in this case a transport service), must not be qualified as \u2018an information society service\u2019.

Personal data which have undergone pseudonymisation, which could be attributed to a natural person by the use of additional information should be considered to be information on an identifiable natural person.

To ascertain whether means are reasonably likely to be used to identify the natural person, account should be taken of all objective factors, such as the costs of and the amount of time required for identification, taking into consideration the available technology at the time of the processing and technological developments.
